Mindthefox,"So far, this app has proven to be reliable. I‚Äôve started a new job and my second paycheck was still 5 days away when I realized that my bills would barely be out of reach. I saw an ad on tv for Dave and thought it might be a good fit for me. When asking for an advance, I saw that it could take up to 8 hours to transfer, which inclined me to do it sooner than later just in case I would find myself needing the money and not having the time to wait. Next, Dave told me I could pay it back on my next payday, but when choosing an option they only allowed me to select one of the next 2 days. Dave could tell from my transaction history that my next payday wouldn‚Äôt be for another 4 days and I had a hard time finding out what penalties I would accrue for being late. But, my phone battery was dying, and internet would be shut off if I hadn‚Äôt gone through with it, so I picked the latest possible day and moved on. Without knowing my outcome of this experience, I‚Äôd have to say that so far the app has been straightforward, honest, and very handy for personal bookkeeping. I would just like to know more about my payback options and how I can avoid making a bigger hole than I started with, or else I would give 5 stars.

**update**
I was not charged an extra penalty for taking a little longer to pay back my advance. This was my only concern, but now I feel like Dave has shaken my concerns and fulfills my expectations. Would recommend","*Updated* Great app, allowed time to pay!",5,FALSE,11/30/2019 0:07,
krzylkafox,"I found Dave via Facebook and read a lot of comments from people making fun of the service, making it sound like people who need it don‚Äôt manage their money very well. I was curious to see what it was about and why others feel the need to make fun of people who use it, so I downloaded the app (not expecting to use it, but to just see what it was). As circumstances presented themselves, being a single mom with zero help from the other parent, and trying to provide for my kids (I work full time and go to school full time so I can put myself in a better place, but until then things are pretty tight) - I found myself facing an overdrawn check fee (I wrote a check to register my daughter for school and had something else clear my checking account that wasn‚Äôt supposed to go through, which means I didn‚Äôt have enough funds for the check I wrote). I remembered I‚Äôd installed the Dave app a couple of weeks ago and within a few minutes, I was approved for a small loan and because I paid the extra $4.99 expedite fee, the money was deposited into my bank account within the hour. Dave only charges a $1.00 fee to loan you the money plus any tip you‚Äôre willing to donate, but is not required. When your paycheck is due to deposit, Dave takes the loan and fee back out of your bank account and that‚Äôs all there is to it! It‚Äôs very easy and painless and definitely worth the $1.00 fee to not have to pay an overdraft/insufficient funds fee to your bank.",Truly Awesome,5,FALSE,8/23/2018 17:53,"{'id': 5527605, 'body': ""Hi krzylkafox, we're so glad to hear about your experience!

Damon_Williams,"I am a natural skeptic when it comes to apps such as these, but just today I had a real-world experience that Dave helped me out with. The deets:
This morning, I had an out-patient procedure at a hospital in downtown Philly. I was supposed to take my wife‚Äôs ATM card and use that for parking. I‚Äôm my haste, not only do I forget her card, but I also left my main ATM card at home, leaving me only with my phone, Apple Watch, backup ATM card and 20 bucks. After my procedure I return to the lot to discover that parking was $26 - $6 more than I had on me. Wife works 40 minutes away and no way she could text me the money through iMessage, since the lot is not ApplePay-ready. Stranded, I was, staring at my car in this lot. Then it dawned on me that on a whim, I previously downloaded this Dave app. I was very skeptical about providing my bank info, but since that is the only way to realistically obtain an advance, I submitted my banking info, verified my identity and email address, and miraculously Dave fronted me 20 bucks, on the spot. I was able to immediately withdraw it and pay for parking and drive off the lot. Without this service, instead of writing this review I would still be downtown, trying to figure out how to get my car off the lot!!
I don‚Äôt foresee using this app much, but I wanted to share with you all a real-world example of this app being s lifesaver.

Katie ralphs dave appli.,"Hello! So my boyfriend was my resource for finding out about these apps out there that will help you with money until payday! He goes thru the app called ‚ÄúEarnin‚Äù which was the one I was initially going to go threw but because of all the info they needed and how long it would take I chose ‚ÄúThe Dave‚Äù app! Now the thing that doesn‚Äôt make any sense and really makes me mad, is Earnin app borrows my boyfriend as much as he needs from his upcoming check! Which is  what I was expecting and needing from Dave app! This app only gives me $20 dollars! Honestly that is just an insult and not even helpful! What is 20 bucks going to do to help me out, especially in today‚Äôs world and with 4 kids that need to be fed and a vehicle that needs gas to allow me to get to work? It is not enough money to help a family or even a single person! You need to make it available to borrow what the customer wants and or needs! They are the ones who pay it back and it‚Äôs there decision and or problem what they chose to borrow from there next check! You guys take the money right out our accounts automatically so I don‚Äôt see the issue with not allowing your customers really get the help they need. That would also make you guys more money because we as customers would tip you way more better. Please explain why it‚Äôs only 20 dollars I can borrow for 5 days until I get paid :( ?

ayethecoinstho,"usually never do reviews but i HAD too for dave. i been using dave for a while and it has been helping me keep with gas and food until my next paycheck. i love the fact that it sends the money asap if you ask for it early enough. they start you off with a $75 limit which mines has just increased to $100 because i use it so much and have it auto drafted back out to pay. also as soon as you do pay it back you can request more
next day which is helpful especially if that money you had to pay back is something you may have needed for something else. so it literally helps keep money in your pocket if you have a job. these are all great things about dave but the reason i wrote this review is because of the way dave handles getting their money back. i just moved to another state and got some money from dave to help with that. i just found a job in the new state but i haven't been gettin paid yet so i am behind on my pack-back to dave. I JUST WANNA PRAISE DAVE ON NOT TRYING TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF MY ACCOUNT WHEN ITS NOT THERE. they check 1st which is so nice cause alot of us using the app are already not very financially stable or literate and we need all the money we can get and getting this overdraft or ach fees really hurt us more than you know.

tazatezo,"Since they were able to validate my account they were able to give me the $75 loan without any tricks. They took it out as soon as my direct deposit came in so if I needed to get another advance the next morning I could do it around 3-5am before the day starts so you don‚Äôt have to go half the day waiting for it to give you the green light to put in for another advance! I have no issues navigating site. The only issue I have is after you agree and swipe ok to get the advance the next screen it goes to is the Dave Bear with hands up and a green bar at bottom saying thank you and if you don‚Äôt pay attention you will press the Thank You Bar thinking it‚Äôs just the final page like a second swipe to make sure you meant to agree to it, but it‚Äôs really an effort by them to get a tip out of you which I got caught on it and now I am into it for an additional 10 Dollars which I would never have agreed upon!! If the times are tough enough to need an advance I am not in position to be giving out a 10 tip on top of the $4,99 charge to put it in account right away for no charge you can wait I think 3-4 days for it to go into account so I am now paying 90 dollars for the 75 which I definitely will never ever give a tip again!!!

idkwhyme1995,"I‚Äôve had Dave for months now, and I get paid every week EARLY! Not only is THAT a great incentive, but I expected this app to be like many others, (where they lie, basically) lol. But DAVE actually gives you $200 advances. (You can advance anywhere from $100-$200) You just hit the ‚Äúadvance‚Äù tab and select your advance amount. You have it deducted immediately when your next ACH direct deposit check that clears in your Dave Spending Account, or, you can pay it back early with another form of payment. 
NOTE: a potential advance DOES REQUIRE proof that you can pay Dave back. It‚Äôs not just free money. You have to build a rapport. You start out at $25 advances when you open the account, and then as you get ACH direct deposits, keep money in your account, and advance and pay him back regularly from YOUR money, you can then advance $100, $150, or $200. Once your advance is paid back, there‚Äôs a ‚Äúcool off‚Äù period, which is a few days where you can‚Äôt advance, and then you can advance again after that. I LOVE THIS FEATURE. Sometimes I have to say, I spend my money frivolously, (not proud of it) and I need a little bit extra to get through the week. So it works out perfectly with timing with the ‚Äúcool off‚Äù period, too! It allows me to budget better AND monitor my spending.

DoesThisNickNameEvenMatter,"So I really do enjoy this ‚Äúapp,‚Äù if that‚Äôs what it should be called, but I have a few opinions about it. Dave definitely helps organize finances by giving advances when needed. However, the terms of when you can take an advance, and how much you can ask for, are very unorganized. I have taken out advanced, and I have paid them all back, in full and on time, but there are stipulations that users aren‚Äôt made privy to until the ‚Äúapp‚Äù drops that bomb on them. For someone who is not over drafted in their own bank account, OR in the Dave app, and someone who makes their payments in full and on time, there shouldn‚Äôt be a limit on how much they can ask for, or when they can ask for it. If these limitations are there to make it easier for the user to handle their finances responsibly, there should be more leniency towards those that are in good financial standing with Dave. If I have ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù money, multiple times, and paid it back in FULL, MULTIPLE times, EVERY time, the limitations should not occur. I understand the app is new, and the kinks are still being worked out, so me being as detailed as possible should benefit those working on making Dave the best it can be. Thank you for your time, and as I will continue to use Dave, I hope to see improvements that cater to users that are responsible with their usage.

kcaftxga,"Initially I was skeptical to install and use an app requiring entry of my banking account info, but after reading dozens of mostly-positive reviews I decided to give it a try. Entering my bank account info and inputting my paycheck schedule was quick and easy, and not long after the verification was completed I requested and received a $75 cash advance. Over the course of a couple months I requested and received three $75 advances, each of which was paid from my checking account on the scheduled date. However, this week I attempted another advance but the app reflected it did not register my most recent paycheck, thereby limiting to $20 the amount I could advance. Upon trying to update the paycheck schedule (which has NOT changed, mind you), the app informed me it could not offer advances based on manual paycheck entry. This issue was something I read in many reviews, but I opted to continue with the installation and use of the app. Now, due to the frustrating glitch in the app‚Äôs ability to record my always-on-time paychecks and other, static monthly deposits, there really is no point in keeping the app on my phone. Currently I am evaluating the use of other, similar apps, as I see no need to maintain the Dave app because it no longer properly records my paycheck information.

This month, money was tight. It is tight. I thought I could count on Dave to get my $75 advance, but I ended up overdrafting three dollars. So I was -3 dollars.

emaleenoelle,"I don‚Äôt usually like leaving reviews but I felt that it was more than necessary for me to do a review of Dave. First of all, the setup process after I downloaded the app was SO fast and SO simple. They walked me through the setup very easily, and they even had some budgeted items already preset for me after they analyzed my bank account. That was a pretty cool feature. But the BEST PART OF ALL is that they let me borrow money from my upcoming paycheck on the SAME DAY that I downloaded the app. There was absolutely no waiting period or trial period before I was approved to borrow. I was honestly amazed by that. Most apps that offer payday type of loans will make you wait up to 30 days before you can borrow but not Dave!

My friend told me to download this app. I didn‚Äôt think much about it before because I use Earnin App. But I had just gotten off 2 weeks vacation so Earnin wouldn‚Äôt let me borrow until my next paycheck. With no other options,  I download this app. It was very user friendly and didn‚Äôt take up too much time to set up. I didn‚Äôt have to wait 1-3 business days or anything. I literally signed up put my information in, told them when I‚Äôd pay it back, and within a few minutes (depending on ur bank it takes longer, but USAA Bank is instant) the money transferred and I got home safely. The tips you leave give a percentage to charity which is really great. Also Earnin app only lets u use true bank u get paid from and has a whole verification process which is annoying but understandable I guess.

JacksNeu82,"When I heard about the Dave app I though yeah right a app that will lend you money if you are in a jam with 0% interest??? To good to be true, so I downloaded it and looked at the app, read everything I could read on the app. And IT WAS TRUE! The only thing you pay back is what you borrowed and a small tip which you can pick the amount if you wanted to tip .75 cents instead of the suggest amount you could, and all for $1.00 a month that‚Äôs it.
    But than I was never able to borrow money for some reason every time I would try it would give some message. So finally one day I was going to delete the app, when I was asked why I told them and they said give them some time to look at it and I got 2 months free. Next I know I received a email saying I was able to borrow from Dave. So the customer service is pretty good as far as I could tell.
     The only thing I don‚Äôt like about the app is once you borrow and they take it from your pay, you have to wait 11 days from your next pay to borrow again. Sometimes the money may be needed before that. 
      All in all the app is pretty good I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is in a jam, needs help with there bank account. The Dave app has definitely saved me from accidentally over-drafting a few times. I‚Äôm glad I downloaded the app.",Dave is helpfull,4,FALSE,3/16/2019 9:43,

After deciding to download it, I linked my bank account and asked to borrow $25 (you have the option of $25, 50 or 75). You can wait 1-2 business days or pay an extra $3.98 for it to be in your bank acct within 8 hrs. I chose to pay the few extra dollars to have it fast and once I opened up my banking app, it was already there. From the time I downloaded Dave, to the time I logged out, it was less than 10 mins and I had the $25 in my account. That fast!! I will definitely be keeping this app on hand so I can bypass the embarrassment of asking to borrow money again. And another awesome thing?

pAuLLwALL2252,I use Dave quite often. Honestly have nothing bad to say about it when you‚Äôre tight with money and can‚Äôt get through the week without gas money or even just to eat Dave was always there to help. If you‚Äôre job offers direct deposit then it‚Äôs easy to set up. Based on what you‚Äôre income is they will let you take out $100 or $75. When you get an advancement it usually takes 3 days but if you need it ASAP they will charge you $5 on top of what you‚Äôre taking out for the advancement. You can set up the day you can pay the advancement back the best thing is when they are ready to get paid back they automatically do it for you. If the money doesn‚Äôt hit yet they take a little bit out of you‚Äôre account so your bank balance doesn‚Äôt go to a negative that right there is really awesome. They care about making sure your account doesn‚Äôt go negative even though you owe them money they will wait until you have money in your account before they take it out. Other than that it‚Äôs really convenient to have. I personally haven‚Äôt had any issues other than waiting for payments to process or loans to come through that‚Äôs the only thing that takes a while.

Mindy9171,"I downloaded Dave several months ago but my bank wasn‚Äôt listed to use soI requested they add it. It took a few months but I kept checking back and soon my bank had been added. Due to unexpected family medical emergency I needed help so I did the cash advance with Dave. The process was very easy and my money was deposited into my account at the end of the day even though it said it would take eight hours. They don‚Äôt charge interest or a fee for the advance, except for the five dollars if you need the cash fast, but you can include a tip which I was happy to do. Unlike the Earnin app, which tracks the hours you work at a physical address before it will advance your money, Dave looks at your income history and then determines how much it‚Äôs able to allow you to request. The max available is $75 but if you‚Äôre approved for that amount it gives you the option to take $50 or $25 instead which I liked. I think this is a great app especially because the end of the month is hard for a lot of people and in times of emergency it comes in handy.

Mad jack 406,Well I‚Äôve used this service 3 times and the first two times I‚Äôve gotten my money right away by paying the three dollars. But on my third time using it I paid the three dollars and it said it was deposited in my account I confirmed it and then the next morning it was gone and they still said it was going to be paid back on my next payday but yet I had no money from them and it put my account in the negative. Later on the second day I received a message saying it was sent and should be there soon and asking for a review but yet I still don‚Äôt have what I asked for they say it was sent the bank can find no records for it. Needless to say I‚Äôm not happy. Also the way they kinda trick you into adding a tip is kinda shady they should put a close button on the screen if you do not want to include a tip. And the default is 15% if you don‚Äôt pay attention you will pay back plus the 15%. Now for me if I‚Äôm hurting for money and need to borrow some this is an awesome service but 15% is kinda high if a person is strapped for cash.

You can adjust some bills if they are irregular or even add a new bill. I have only needed to advance on 2 separate occasions so far.

Mike Singa P.,"I‚Äôm fond of this app as it‚Äôs helped me in certain situations however as I write this review I can‚Äôt help but compare it to its competitors. The backend system cannot account for split direct deposits, If you receive a split direct deposit between checking and savings account in this $800 and $900. The system will only recognize your payroll as $800 thus potentially impacting your borrowing ability. Dave also is not capable of understanding update to date balances, so if your account WAS negative even for a day and now has a balance of $500. It would take days before allowing you to borrow funds, simply because ‚Äúyour account is too low to bring to positive‚Äù. Finally there‚Äôs is no real time support like Earnin App, where you can chat and get questions answered immediately. I‚Äôve sent in a ticket to Dave 8 hours ago and haven‚Äôt heard back and while one may say they need more time and one must bear personal financial responsibility, times are tough, meaning time is crucial.

SaeDDee,When I first downloaded the app I was quite skeptical about it. After a couple of days I decided to go ahead and see what the fuss was about. Everything seemed like it was going smoothly and I want to head and requested a small amount of money to be deposited into my account. I opted to choose the express delivery because then I would receive the money in eight hours or less. Well it has been over eight hours and almost an entire 24 hours and I still have not received the money. I am very disappointed because I paid the extra $1.99 and I do believe that if I paid for that and then I should have received the money quicker.

Seeing as I removed all my money from that account the first month after the first overcharge not to get into another overdraft for the upcoming month, only to find out that indeed I had yet another overdraft charge from Dave. I find this frustrating as this is an app to help prevent overdrafts and not only have I not been verified after two months, but now have gotten two overdrafts from this company.

Which was okay; I literally had no money at the time and had just completed my first week at a new job, so $5 was better than nothing. And since I was advanced that $5, I can‚Äôt request more until I pay that back. That‚Äôs very fair. 
Dave will withdraw the $5 plus interest (I think that is what that fee is?) plus a 15% tip that I chose to add. So, in total, on my next pay day, Dave will take $7.74 as a repayment of my loan. I am just keeping Dave on hand should I really need it again, in the future. It‚Äôs a nice lil app to have, definitely try it out!",Came in handy,5,FALSE,6/10/2019 0:54,
MAArch7,"Dave is a great app for anyone and everyone who not only needs a bit of cash early before payday but also for tracking expenses, watching for potential overdraft on your account and so on.  Easy to use, easy to connect your bank account to and just overall user friendly.  The only thing I wish they did was to offer to front a little more cash than they offer to do.  I switched banks and had an easy time changing them over on the app but my previous advance max was $75 and now it‚Äôs only a max of $20 which I don‚Äôt understand b/c my direct deposit of my paycheck is the same.  I hope they increase the advance amount as $20 doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference ($75 doesn‚Äôt make a huge splash either but at least its a grocery trip).  Some other apps I have used offer upwards of $250 - $350 advance amounts as long as you have the linked bank account with your verified direct deposit of your paycheck.  That obviously makes a much larger impact in getting that level of cash earlier than payday.  Otherwise, great app for anyone looking for a few extra bucks before payday.",Great app!,4,FALSE,11/14/2019 17:44,

The one largest downfall in my opinion is the charge of $5.99 to be able to use the money right away, on top of a tip that is required also.
 
There are other apps where the money is instantly moved into you account which makes the most sense in my opinion since the whole idea behind using Dave is to have the money that day, rather than 3 business days it takes if you chose to not pay the extra charge.

Khachilly,I had some people at work mention this app to me. I am very skeptical about things like this so I didn‚Äôt ever really look into it. But when I finally did I had wish I done it sooner. It‚Äôs a really well put together app that lets you advance money from your next pay period early interest free. That‚Äôs amazing ! The only ‚Äúinterest‚Äù is an optional tip that‚Äôs used to plant trees. My ONLY gripe with this app is this bug where it doesn‚Äôt get my pay period dates correctly and I call it a bug because my friends have the same thing happen to them. It recognizes all your direct deposits one day earlier than they actually are going to deposit . In order to advance money you literally have to e-sign saying that you understand this is the day you get paid and are going to pay it back when it‚Äôs actually false but there‚Äôs no way around it.

tony83$,I was skeptical about Dave at first only because I saw it on Facebook... I haven‚Äôt had my Facebook activated in 4 years and just about a month ago I re-activated it and saw Dave. So of course I was skeptical. So I looked into it... read some reviews and still just shrugged my shoulders and moved on. But about a week later I was kinda in a tight spot and literally needed just some gas so I went back to the reviews again and started reading more in depth about Dave... come to find out he had almost all good reviews! Except the few where ppl said that there was ‚Äúhidden‚Äù fees that they didn‚Äôt know about. Well if you read everything that Dave gives you. He tells you about all the fees and what they are for. So really there are t hidden fees. All in all Dave I just want to thank you. You really helped me out! You were very explanatory about how the process works and I‚Äôm completely satisfied!

We were trying to figure out what to do as me and my husband both work and he especially, he‚Äôs a delivery driver. So he needs the car to work. We downloaded the app and within an hour we had money in our account. We had already gotten our car out by the time we downloaded the app but we used the last of our money and had to borrow a little from relatives.

Dave basically checks your income and provides you borrowed money depending on the income etc it‚Äôll be a different amount. Nothing crazy for me it‚Äôs like 75$ so it‚Äôs basically an advance on you next check Incase you don‚Äôt have it now for whatever reason. App is so user friendly and looks amazing( the developer deserves appraise) so easy to use once you set up everything. Takes 3 business days to receive want toward your bank account. Unless you pay a rush fee(5$) within 8 hrs you‚Äôll have it. I recommend having this app for emergencies tho they do that have a fee of 1$ a month( which is nothing). The biggest bonus to me is the fact the tips you provide go toward plants. App offers other things like little options you can do to make extra income (other apps like lift, Uber eats, etc).

I chose the expedited delivery option, which costs extra, but the money was deposited seriously within seconds. They don‚Äôt charge you for the quick deposit until you get paid, which is also great.

One of the key features is DAVE will spot you up to $75 and if you pay the $3.99 fee it‚Äôs worth it. You get the money within minutes to your account at least for me it did and I would imagine for most banks it will as well. Now that is a small amount and I wish they would up it to $200 after so many completed pay backs and maybe that is in the works but that would be really nice.

I wrote a check out and forgot about some auto payments coming out of my account, then randomly saw an ad for this on Facebook. It‚Äôs not a huge loan -$75 may be laughable for some but considering I was only going to overdraft by a few dollars, the overdraft fee for my bank is so massive, and I would be getting my next paycheck a day or two after the overdraft would happen, this was worth it. 

If you‚Äôre just the average joe like me, needing a little cushion until pay day, this app is legitimate. I paid the $4.99 to get the express deposit so I can‚Äôt say how long the standard deposit actually takes? But the express deposit was within minutes. 

Anyways, if you‚Äôre sitting there wondering if it‚Äôs a real app or a scam, it‚Äôs real and very helpful when you‚Äôre in a pinch.

However, after signing in, and saving the password, the Dave app is consistently trying to sign in with the INCORRECT information which has locked me out of my bank account multiple times a week, causing me to have to call customer service to unlock it. With times like these due to covid-19, call volumes are ridiculous as far as wait time.

Boonekl,"I thought the Dave app was a joke because it sounded too good to be true, but decided to give it a try anyway. I‚Äôve been loving it for the most part ever since downloading the app. My only two complaints are that 1. oftentimes when I click on something to edit it, a different bill pops up instead and 2. I had to delete most of the bills I‚Äôd inputted because it was giving me the wrong balance (didn‚Äôt match my bank balance) and then re-enter them as they came in. I will say that the last part may be due to user error so take that with a grain of salt.

I was approved for an advance, which I could really use right now as my state is locked down.  I don‚Äôt need a loan, just a little cash to for some groceries.  I hit the button to get 75 dollars and it told me I needed to set up a way to pay it back.

Shelby5642,"This is a great app for me when I just need a few bucks to get me to payday. These guys make sure you can pay it back before allowing you to take it out. Once they confirm your bank account they look for your paydays. I had to send my stubs as proof but that‚Äôs because my paydays are a little weird so it was harder for the app to find a pattern. You also have to make sure you have about $160 in your account a few days following your paydays before they will send you money. I‚Äôm a cash person so I had to make sure I kept money in my account a few extra days before I got approved. 

There is a few dollar fee for them to send the money and you can pick your tip. The tip is how they make their money. I‚Äôm on my second successful advance and I found this much easier than pawn and payday loans.

Gjvon,"I can say a lot about this application. 
1. It helps 2. It is safe 3. It is addictive

1. It helps having a backup constantly. I remember when I was homeless and needed 75 bucks for a place to stay. This really REALLY helped me stay positive and get through it. I am now getting my own place and I still use it and donate regularly. 

Once you are trusted and accepted, the application works wonders for you and their customer service doesn‚Äôt fail. You tell them how much you need and confirm your payback date and amount. I‚Äôve never missed these not over-drafted so I‚Äôm assuming that helps me a lot in the future. 

You pay it on the confirmed date and do it over again. This gets addicting. Hence note 3.

2. It is safe. Keep in mind that you are borrowing money. It‚Äôs pretty much them trusting you with free money. So be a decent person and give them the money back. This app is a god send. The donation is a plus. 

3. It is addicting. The money is borrowed. It‚Äôs a luxury, not a right. Be careful with how you use this app. I find myself taking $75 out even when my dumb$&$ don‚Äôt need it. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs because it feels like a game. It‚Äôs cool. Logically, it makes no sense for me to use this app. Honestly guys, only use this when you absolutely need something right now.

r_beez,"What really persuaded me to get Dave was the comments on Facebook. I cracked up at almost every response he had and it just made me feel a little less intimidated to go through the app because he made it seem like there was no problems.

Most times I‚Äôm able to make it through to the next paycheck but there are times like these when you need that someone when nobody else is there to help. Especially being the sole provider and having two kiddos, it gets kind of tough. But luckily Dave came along to the rescue and I was able to make sure we made it through to next payday.

I'm not too happy with Dave. Maybe I don't understand how it works or what it's for but I thought it was for if you need a few dollars in a pinch and also to help you budget better. Then how come I don't get the advance? Dave automatically connects to your account and then basically creates a budget based on account history. Why is Dave budgeting bills that I have already paid with nyasr paycheck and saying that I will be overdrawn before my next check? No. I already paid those bills for the month so why would they be coming out again in 2 weeks? Also it won't let me add my own bills and when it did and I put in the frequency it kept treating them as if they hadn't already come out for this month. And then I'll still be charged $1 for this??

So customer service fixed the issue and I was able to get the loan. Now I could possibly be confusing this app with another but I thought you paid back what you wanted as a ‚Äútip‚Äù on top of the money you borrowed. Not only did they take the $75, but also $4.99. Then a few hours later I got a notification that the app took another $1for what? I have no idea.

***UPDATE #2***
So normally in order to use this app I have to email customer support and wait for them to fix one of the 2 or 3 common issues I have with it. 1) My payday doesn‚Äôt align with the date I selected.
2) That ‚ÄúDave‚Äù can only advance $10 because I won‚Äôt have enough to pay him back even though each payday I take home around $1300

what for xtraxgz,At first when I first signed up I wasn‚Äôt able to qualify for any of the advances because I had no consistent stream of income so I was kind of upset because I mostly work and get paid in cashBut as soon as I was able to show verifiable income Dave quickly considered me for at least some sort of advance and I also would like to mention that the app is very helpful when you‚Äôre trying to learn how to budgetAnd it has actually saved me from overdrafting because I was given a warning several days before it happened it was a bill that I totally forgot about so thank you Dave you‚Äôre awesomeBeen fair and I like that yeah it would be nice if you loan me $1 million but you‚Äôre not trying to get scammed which is understandable so I would advise anyone to ignore any bad reviews because they actually are a pretty great company,Totally awesome and helpful app.,5,FALSE,5/6/2021 18:18,

Long story short my ex developed a drug addiction and wrote checks out to himself for hundreds of dollars. As such I‚Äôve been in danger of over-drafting a lot recently as my income has barely been meeting my expenses until I can get things back under control and develop savings again.

Why do I like Dave? Dave lets me borrow money and then gives me the option on how much I‚Äôd like to ‚Äútip‚Äù. (I‚Äôve been doing just 10% lately because I‚Äôm still on shaky ground financially). Part of that tip goes to charity, which is awesome! The rest goes to gross revenue to the developer, which can be expected.

I will say I wish most apps (not just Dave) would integrate better with PNC. It‚Äôs one of the biggest banks in the country, but between this, Mint, MoneyLion, CreditKarma, etc. it‚Äôs always a hassle to try to link my PNC account for some reason.

It‚Äôs awesome to be able to access quick money when you need it, and that is why I continue to return when it‚Äôs needed. However, in order to get the repayment set up on my actual pay date(the app continues to try and get repaid before my check hits my account), there is not an easy option. It will not allow me to change it and when I call they say the date is what it is. Well each time they pull my payment early as my check isn‚Äôt in my account yet, my bank charges me non refundable $30 fee and when brought up to Dave they have offered no assistance. There are many other apps that do the same thing as Dave and I may just begin using only those, as they work with you and their accessibility and ease of change to correct dates to avoid fees is MUCH easier/better.","Good, thankful but could have more options for success",3,FALSE,6/1/2020 19:00,"{'id': 15734595, 'body': ""Oh no! üôà Your payback date aligns with your next payday.

Hyper_Forsaken,"I saw the ad on my FB timeline & decided to give it a go since I needed only a lil‚Äô bit of money.  I downloaded & took about 10 mins. to enter my personal info & bank details.  The Dave App knows if you have direct deposit automatically which was neat because I thought I would need to enter this tidbit.  I opted to get instant $75 & that cost $4.99 instead of waiting 3 days which would be free.  

Only drawback albeit minor:

- App froze on me after I got my money because it didn‚Äôt reflect my actual bank account funds.  So, I had to restart my iPhone twice.

- I get a text the day after I already received my money saying your money is being sent & on the way.  Please leave us a review if it was helpful.  I‚Äôm thinking this is a really good app & to receive this irrelevant text, why bother to even inform me to leave a reply.  I already intended to because I do want others to know this app is legit.  Let the app do its function & let users decide of their own accord to leave a good &/or bad review.

All in all: I like this app & got the $75 super fast but I had to pay $4.99 to get it instantly.  Didn‚Äôt need lots of cash, just enough to hold me over until payday.  This app provides it.

8bitAnalyst,"This app is a very helpful way to keep tabs on your budget, and make it easy to see how much of your income is going into what; helps you with categorizing and organizing monthly expenses. 

Another thing this app offers is advances on your next paycheck. However, the advances are considerably smaller than what you see from other popular cash-advance apps, like earnin. I still think it can be very helpful for preventing things like overdrafts when you're over-leveraged and need a small sum to clear fund transfer. 

Types of advances: 
The ""Dave"" advances - apparently you can get an advance of up to $100, but you have to join the waitlist, who knows how long that will take. 

The other type is just an advance you can receive when you link your bank so they can confirm your payroll frequency and spending habits. 

I'm only given the choice of up to a $20 bank account advance, but this could be because of my spending habits.

I frequently transfer funds out of my bank to a brokerage account, recently had a hiccup where my expenses overlapped the transfers. Don't do that lol. But if I had Dave to transfer literally just at least $10, I wouldn't have had to suffer the $9 transfer reversal fee and $30 overdraft fee that resulted.

I will say the app does have problem involving pay periods and it might not work when you download it when you try to put in pay period information or editing it but once it get formal with you account transactions you will not have to worry about that. But I didn‚Äôt qualify for the $75 because I don‚Äôt make that much on my Check you have to make a certain amount to get the $75 advancement.

The $4.99 fee to have the money transferred to my bank account within 8 hours (but it was only like two minutes for me) is quite steep in my opinion, but I‚Äôm enjoying using Dave so far.

Edit: This was my first reaction to Dave. Since then they dropped the transfer fee to 2.99 which is great.

ElitewolfGang13,"Edit: the money was in my account ready to use just after 15 minutes of requesting money. Super impressive and super satisfied I didn‚Äôt have to wait long. Plus yesterday was a Sunday, BOOM! 

I love this app, honestly it‚Äôs so convenient to able to request an extra 75$ without having to borrow it from family or friends. You don‚Äôt have to burden them with those questions because let‚Äôs face it, we all need money and we are always coming up short, there is really no extra to lend to others. 

That‚Äôs why I love this app, they give you 3 amount options to choose from,also while showing you a purpose of good karma because you can also tip to plant trees. If every company out there has consumer options to improve and impact the world just imagine how much more we would all benefit from it. 

This app is plain and simple and has a great purpose. I just selected 75$ with an 8% tip so not only does this app give you a relief of cash but since they are able to be so kind we should all think about giving back what we can. Also the message said 8 hours max time to wait for cash but last time it took just under 2 hours. Thanks Dave and Team! You make our lives that more convenient!",Need money NOW!

They need to be more transparent with their information, their process needs to be better streamlined and outlined for folks so people actually understand it and can decide if this is actually a feasible option for them or not.

I had only found out about the app a few days ago but even just the few days, it was really cool knowing that I could just grab a quick loan for food and gas, borrowing against my check without having to lean on my family who are dealing with their own struggle. And that tip system is really cool as it‚Äôs basically me setting my own interest rate and payback on the loan.

I was getting unemployment on Wednesdays and when I first got paid from my new job was a Thursday and a different app took the money on Wednesday assuming that was when I got paid and there was no way for me to adjust the pay back date.

My normal payday is Wed, but my bank credits it on Tues, usually. 
I needed $75 which was quickly approved. My issues with this app are this. The payback choices are the day you take the money.

I needed just a few dollars to get some gas in my car for the week and everything with the app went smooth and well. I will update when it goes to pay the app back next week but so far so good.

Cool part is that you get it for pretty much free if you don‚Äôt need it immediately and can wait a few days but there is an option to pay to get it immediately which you pay back when you get paid not out of the advance they give you.

Aside from that I have nothing but positive and great things to say about this app. WAY better than the old walk in cash advance places where you have to wait in line & then everyone there can hear your business.

Meik29,Within the Dave app you can see where you have made purchases in the pass and it also helps you budget! When I was approved for a small loan I was excited because I needed to pay my light bill. I check out my bank account and saw that the loan was taken out which I was fine with. It wasn't until I went into the app to get another advance my loan wasn't paid and noticed that I was charged at a store called Walmart for a purchase of $86 that I never made. I thought it was very odd that same amount that I owe the Dave app. I contacted the Dave company and still not response.

@Sugaarlips,"I don‚Äôt like that this app charges a fee to express your money into your account in minutes. 

  Also, you have a optional option to tip which that part I understand. Tipping helps the money circulate in the GoDave App community BUT the fact that they say depending on what amount you tip it helps buy a healthy meal for kids, it makes me feel more obligated to tip more money that I can‚Äôt afford on top of the fee they charge.

 SECONDLY, I can‚Äôt afford to wait 3 business days either which is fee free. Most people are need of extra money sooner. That‚Äôs why we download the app ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I just feel like they need to update their policy to a more convenient system for people who are need of money before payday and faster delivery options without fees.

The only thing I like about GoDave is they give you a few newer suggestions on how to make money on the side in addition to the job you already have different from the common mobile delivery apps.

Earnin doesn‚Äôt charge fees, you just tip what you can per payout. It also has lightening delivery for free within minutes.

K- Rye,"Dave currently allows you to borrow up to $75 from a future check and charges you roughly 6% as a fee for that service if you want the money to hit your account quickly. The downside to this is the same downside for all payday loans. You can potentially get locked into a borrowing cycle where you are taking the funds every time they‚Äôre available because you need them to cover the funds you ended up being short on your check because you borrowed funds to cover what you were short on the previous check.

There is a $5 express fee to transfer the money but I don‚Äôt mind because it is $30 cheaper than overdraft fees with my bank.

I was supposed to receive a refund from a PayPal order I placed and on Friday received an email stating it may take up to 5 days to process. We need groceries and food to make it til the next week. I instantly uploaded info and within an hr I was given the funds I needed to make sure we could get some food. Such a great thing to offer for people that goes thru faster than pretty much anything else that‚Äôs offered out there. I will def have it in case of emergency in which this was because already had a headache dealing with receiving the refund to begin with.,Great App,5,FALSE,7/13/2019 18:01,

However this last Friday, I was looking to get an advance for $75 again but the app kept saying that my account needed atleast $105 to qualify. This made no sense because my account DID have over $105 and the app still gave me the same error message. I then proceeded to email one of the customer reps about the matter and the responding email promised me that someone would reply within 24 hours. It has now been over 2 days and I still have not received a reply. Also I went ahead and chose the $20 advance from Dave and it‚Äôs been 2-3 days and I still have not received the money from them.

HappyWife2016,So I downloaded this app after seeing ads for it on Facebook. The first couple of times I used it they gave me an advance for $75.

They they told me last month that I need to keep at least $105 in my account in order to qualify for $75 and now today they are telling me $300 needs to remain in my account after pay day to qualify for $75.

Dave has not worked out all the bugs when I comes to recognizing pay from sources like Uber and Lyft so if you get laid by one of these groups or someone else like them Dave more then likely will not be able to help you simply because their system does not see your pay as regular pay check.

Hardrocks Wife,"Since I‚Äôm always in kind of hurry with everything I have to do throughout my day, 
I just wanted to say that other than a few minor issues that I‚Äôve experienced in which I did indeed send an email explaining my problem and as promised my issue was definitely addressed in a timely manner. 
Actually on a couple of occasions my issue was taken care of as quickly as they read the message I sent to the Dave app team.

It‚Äôs pretty awesome always having something like the Dave app to always actually count on to be there for those tough spots during the month.

Honestly anybody that just needs that small little helping hand every now and again this is your best option, 
For starters I didn‚Äôt believe that the site would even do the things it was claiming it would do,

I‚Äôm not using your service anymore. 
Because when I needed it, it wasn‚Äôt available to me. I‚Äôve been struggling with your app for 4-5 months, and I‚Äôm talking about passed the initial setup. There is another company out there that is easy to use and fast. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm using and that‚Äôs what I will continue to use. 

Your process is way too convoluted. If I need money I need it now! And all too often your app said I couldn‚Äôt have it now. It said I didn‚Äôt have enough money in my account to barrow, or that is was too close to me getting paid, or that I just got paid (I get paid every seven days), or it can‚Äôt verify my paychecks deposits, or the debits. The app is checking my bank at lest every two hours from what I saw. However it sent me IM‚Äôs and notifications saying I was gonna overdraw, but wouldn‚Äôt let me barrow! Ha! It‚Äôs like a carrot I can‚Äôt have. 

My two cents is to spend more money on building a better process and make it faster and easier to use and spend less money on the aesthetics and marketing of the bear, and you might have a good app in the future.

jfh_007,"The app description states multiple times that you can get an advance of $100 (which is an incredibly small amount). However, once you download the app it only offers you $75, if you link your debit card AND agree to Dave sharing your purchase activity with third parties. The $100 advance is related to opening a checking account with Dave and said feature hasn‚Äôt even launched yet. 

FWIW, $75 is such a tiny amount to advance. Some people are only offered $10-$20 for an advance, which is laughable in 2021. I would recommend just saving a little and then advancing yourself said amount. There‚Äôs no need to pay a monthly fee in order to have the opportunity to receive such a small advance. 

Also, for an expedited advance (which takes 8 hours) they charge you a fee of $5. The free advance takes 3 business days. 
 
Furthermore, tipping is NOT optional. It‚Äôs the tip percentage that you get to choose, but it will not accept anything below a 1% tip.

TechnoCatKat,I‚Äôve served in the military for some years now and have been fortunate that the paychecks that service members get cover everything from bills to food and gas. About a month ago my car that I used for everything has seen its days. I‚Äôve bought parts and invested time into fixing it but alas to no avail thus I had to put a down payment for a new truck. It caused a huge set back on my finances and trying to keep up with the bills put me in a tight spot. Fortunately Dave here has greatly aided in the financial balance process for my family and I. Thank you Dave.,Hats Off,5,FALSE,7/2/2019 16:44,
Waterlilz,I used this app last week because I was in a bind and didn‚Äôt have any other means to quickly make any cash. Within minutes of downloading the app I had enough cash to get gas and grocery for the week. There‚Äôs a fee if you want it quickly but if you can wait a few days then the transfer is feee.

KazuyaDorya,"The App is decent, but it requires a $1/mo subscription, and it‚Äôs same day Cash deposit feature costs $5.  On top of that, they ask that you ‚ÄúTip‚Äù their service, in return by saying that they will plant ‚ÄúX‚Äù amount of trees increasing with the more money you decide to tip. The bad thing is, it‚Äôs default set to tip ELEVEN DOLLARS, the App hopes that you just select ‚ÄúOK‚Äù on their default tip amount. It‚Äôs really bad for people that just tap away without looking at the fine details. 

So $5 same day deposit fee, requires $1 a month to use, and also will try to hopefully get $11 more dollars out of it‚Äôs users that don‚Äôt pay much attention. 

The only reason I use this App is because my preferred money app ‚ÄúEarnin‚Äù limited my borrow limit at the moment (does that depending on your paycheck/spend rate). 

If you need Apps of this nature to get by through the week, give Earnin a chance first and this second. 

This App is decent at best, but I feel like they ask for way too much.

Lynn Cincinnati,"Total waste of time. The make you provide your banking information along with your sign in information and password. You provide complete access to your bank account and then they give some line about not being able to see 60 days worth of transactions. 
So you'll have to pay the $1 a month and can't request the $75 advance. 

Not only that but unbeknownst when you set up the app it automatically has a setting to where you are 'tipping' a certain percentage for the loan and if you don't read the comments about people borrowing $75 and being charged $86 you would not be aware of this. 

Also when you go to contact the support team, they are of no help and encourage you to cancel membership.

So when you go to select a reason for canceling the app makes it virtually impossible to cancel. It's confusing and I could see people not only clicking exit app and thinking it's been cancelled but you have to select other and write a reason for you to even cancel.

No interest was another sale for me since I know how bad pay day loans can be and cost. They ask you ‚Äútip‚Äù for the advance which is used to plants trees, i hope.

Dave is a great service. You can choose a free deposit which could take 3 business days, or you can choose $5 for an instant deposit within 8 hours. Getting up to $75 depending on your paycheck and your payback history with Dave is amazing.

For one, the second you install it they charge you a dollar. So it‚Äôs a free app to download but once you sign up you owe them a buck. Keep that in mind. It‚Äôs not free. 

They also don‚Äôt immediately advance you, so if you‚Äôre looking for something fast, it probably won‚Äôt be it. They want to track your expenses so it‚Äôs probably a lot of data mining and financial profiling that you‚Äôre providing them. 

If you cancel it‚Äôs difficult to find the option and then they try to scare you by saying you won‚Äôt be able to rejoin for 60 days and then you‚Äôll have to talk to customer service in order to come back. 

Likely this keeps some percentage of people from canceling due to fear of needing an advance later and thinking they‚Äôll be screwed if they cancel it.

But here‚Äôs the thing I wanna make a small payment on my bill and Dave won‚Äôt let. Why is that?
But any who; Dave gave me $20 and I enjoyed that money because I needed it to get bank and fourth to work for 2 Days before I received my big check. So here‚Äôs my thing.

miyna,"That‚Äôs why I gave it two stars. 

Then it stopped working. I have tried since the last update to reconnect my bank with no result, other than being told my credentials are incorrect. This is not the case. I tried contacting support, with no answer for over a week even though they tell you they‚Äôll get to you within 24 hours. I didn‚Äôt even get a ticket number to refer to. It was only by coming to see the review that I found an email that works. Seems the only time they even try to answer is if you leave a bad review. 

My final answer from support? ‚ÄúKeep trying.‚Äù

Like I said, when it works it works, but when it doesn‚Äôt...

EDIT: Finally able to update my account, only to find that it won‚Äôt load any transactions earlier than December 3rd, 2019. Can‚Äôt update my income bc it‚Äôs monthly and I can‚Äôt load more than one month.

A-L-B-1-4-3,"This app is perfect when a little extra cash is needed. If choosing an expedited advance, the money is in your bank within seconds. There is a small fee to expedite but it is worth it. The only things that could be a downside are that it seems like it may be impossible to qualify for the full $100 advance, and on occasion, there can be a limitation on how soon after your paycheck before you can get another advance.

SlimeJai,"Dave pretty much does what it‚Äôs said to do. If you dont have a direct deposit or they can‚Äôt detect one they‚Äôll still let you advance but not $75. Sometimes they don‚Äôt pick up your direct deposit until weeks later which could be an issue if you‚Äôre in a tight situation. Customer service takes FOREVER to get back to you, which is very frustrating because if I‚Äôm contacting CS 9/10 I‚Äôm in need of immediate help.
