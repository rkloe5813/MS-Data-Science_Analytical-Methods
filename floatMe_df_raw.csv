"There are times when my main accounts get SO low (we’re in the middle of a pandemic) that and extra $20 offered by FM would make all the difference in the world. It could feed us and allow us a couple of dollars of gas. In my circumstance,only reason for accessing apps such as float Me is to get that receive and that $20 last a couple of days until my scheduled payday. With the restrictions shown on the app with regard to bank balances, that check to see if you have money in your account or not, will automatically deny your request for a $20 float. The irony is that if I HAD money in my bank account, the necessity to use Float Me wouldn’t exist. As a frequent user, Float Me needs to update their rules in order to help those of us who do not currently have money in their account for a couple of days until payday. We are struggling out here and that $20 could and does keep us from struggling or literally being hungry. My opinion? A bank balance containing cash makes using Float Me rather redundant. This rule should be rethought. This app is useless if a zero balance is the determining factor Thanks for taking the time to read my opinion.",DaphneThrasher,5/21/2021 12:16,"{'id': 23030326, 'body': ""Hi Daphne, thank you so much for your valuable feedback!

"I had closed my account because I couldn’t get a hold of anyone because I had switched to a new bank account. I was receiving money into my new account from Float Me but about a week ago I was told there were no deposits from my payroll found in my account. By this time I was already on two deposits into the new account and the Friday in the same week would have been my third deposit. I didn’t understand why I could receive floats in my new account but when I tried to take another out they couldn’t find new deposits from my payroll there was already two deposits from them. That same week would have been three reoccurring deposits. For the record, $1.99 was taken out of my bank account for Float Me Services’s can my account be unblocked?

"It’s very rare I review any apps, but the customer service on this app is an absolute joke. To be honest I don’t know that they have a customer service team who actually reads what is sent. 17 days, and now today sent my 8th message, none have received any response at all. I’ve been locked out of my account for 3 weeks now. I don’t receive any password reset emails. I keep asking for my account to be canceled since I can access the very basic desktop app. Again, so responses. I try to fill out the cancellation form, it says I don’t have an account. Which is untrue since I’m literally logged into the desktop version, and still being charged the monthly fee. So now, 8 unanswered requests later, I get charged the monthly membership fee! Yes, 17 days, no responses at all. I’ve left them my email, a backup email, and phone number. NOTHING. I need this account cancelled, and if they were legit, I should get my membership fee back. I can screenshot all my messages to prove what I say is true. Worst part is, today’s charge resulted in a banking overdraft fee for me. Turning a $1.99 membership into a $36 fee. I’m beyond upset with this app. STAY AWAY, 1/10.

"Float based on what is deposited into your linked bank account each week. Which is fair as far as I am concerned. The app is a glitchy when applying for float. Example: I applied for my float then entered my debit card for float which is the same as the linked bank account and doesn't change (because you can only get floats to the same debit card EVERY float) they just want you to re-enter the card number. Because I had my debit card account locked it, I had to wait 48 hours before I could re-enter my card number to get my float. They have it set up so you can only enter your card once if for some reason you accidentally mess up while entering your up the creek for 2 days. So just be aware of the little glitches they have set up within there system. Other than that, I have had nothing but a positive experience. I have been using them for 2 weeks so I'll.

"Never have any issues, app is easy to use, the $ usually comes to my account pretty quickly, & just all around a good app. I do wish they would let you borrow more $ instead of going by what’s in your account after you get paid... for example- every 2 weeks my husband gets paid & we end up taking all of our $ off of our card so it looks like we have little to no money & that’s what they go by as far as how much they let us “borrow”.

"This app not only requires you pay them back extra when you borrow money, they also charge you $1.99/mo to have an account which they make no mention of when you set up an account and you'll only find this out when you see it deducted from your bank account each month. Not only that, but also, I asked them to close my account so I would no longer be charged each month. They did close my account, however, they still just took out another $1.99 from my account. To make it even more ridiculous and frustrating, you can only contact their support team by logging into your account, but of course, I don't have an account anymore because they closed it yet still think it's ok to continue to charge me.

Update: and a response I have never taken out a float never really used the app. So I should have never had money be taken out once an account is closed they shouldn’t have access to your bank account and some how this app still does and they continue to take money out until you take action.

I am not a five star guy but I’ll give credit we’re credit is due ,this app is amazing for the most part you get a little security cash in case you need gas or a quick bite until the next day of payday. Only corrals I have are that they start you off real small where other apps will start you you at $200 plus and no need to do direct deposit through the app checking account which this app doesn’t request I believe. Other than that I like it and how you work towards earning more to get a higher advance if needed. Just wish it didn’t start so low.

We understand that there are other platforms that offer larger amounts- we intentionally do not for a few reasons. We actually tried doing to up to $200 back in 2018 when we were testing; we found that most of our members actually only needed $15- $25 to prevent an overdraft- not hundreds of dollars. By offering smaller amounts, we're able to do three key things: 1) Help our members avoid overborrowing. Pew Charitable Trust, the Federal Reserve, and our own research has shown that most platforms encourage their members to overborrow, causing them to become trapped in a debt cycle. We don't believe in doing that and focus on making sure our members can afford to repay their Floats without disrupting their lives. 2) It lets us keep our costs low. We are able to afford to offer free standard floats and have a very low monthly membership fee because there is a LOT less risk when you only float $20 - $30 to a new member vs. $200; a certain number of people unfortunately take advantage and try not to pay us back- the smaller amount helps us avoid having our responsible members be harmed by this. 3) We're able to help more people. If we have $1000 to offer floats, we can only help 5 people if we offer $200 floats. By offering a starting amount of $20 we can help 50 of our members; this is extra important during these very challenging times.\n\nI hope that this helps answer your question and that one day you'll see us as an affordable and thoughtful 5-star service as we continue to release new features and tools for all our members :)"", 'modified': '2020-12-21T03:03:04Z'}",It’s legit it’s not a scam or no hidden nothing,FALSE,4

"Don’t use! Seems I have to keep writing a bad review because they will delete any other bad ones. Had this app for a few months and been subscribing to this garbage for $2. The app only allows you to float $20 unless you increase your “points” by subscribing and buying more. Haven’t been able to use it because even if your facing a overdraft charge it will not even help you out. My bank charges me $35 if I overdraw. So if I have $25 in my account, and I make a purchase for $30. I can’t even go into this app to float me the $15 because my account is already negative in their eyes. Will not assist you in any way. Highly suggest you try out the Dave app instead, it at least helps and floats you up to $100 and even instantly to avoid overdraft.

"Floats little bit of money with high instant delivery fee, but does work if needed.

I don’t think an app that charges you a monthly fee should be charging you “float cash instant” fees. Especially when it’s a $5 fee for $20 spot not including the monthly fee. 

If the app was free to join I would understand the fee. After paying for a monthly subscription it should be part of your services. In order to even qualify they get full access to bank account and paychecks to meet all the criteria’s, so they basically know you’re going to pay you back. I guess if you don’t they have all the information they need to just pull the money anyway. I would understand a fee for not making a payment, if that were to occur, they know it’s unlikely from your banking information, and setting up the paybacks on payday. 

Bottom line I think the point is to help someone is need, who is obviously someone that is reliable, based on the apps standards (which are understandable), but really just makes it harder for them in the long run.

Great app to have during this pandemic. This was literally a life saver. I was robbed for my wallet in VA and I’m from PA. I had no way home. Float Me loaned me $20 instantly that helped me get back home. When is this company going public? I need to invest. I would’ve given 5 stars but they’ve had me on a $20 float forever now.. 😪 I don’t mind because I don’t need it much. At first I thought by using the floats I would be increased. So I used them.

After having the app downloaded for about a month I was finally able to take out a float excited about it since I needed a little extra money for gas I went ahead and took a float of $20 the app said it would charge $4 for it to be instant (within a few minutes to 2 hours) so I’ve been patiently waiting but here we are 6 hours later with no money in my account and no response from support.

Second, we are committed to helping our members prevent overborrowing and only take out what they can afford to repay without undue hardship and based our limits on research by Pew Charitable Trusts and the Federal Reserve. Third, lower limits let us help more people with the same amount of money. If we have $2000 to extend floats, we can only help 20 members if we set starting limits at $100. Instead, we're able to help 100 members with $20 starting limits. Regarding repayment, we follow the rules set by Federal CFPB Early Wage Access regulations; we also do not charge late fees if a member does not have funds to repay on the due date.

"I downloaded this when I was short handed one week. It was nice because the approval process was simple, and I got $10 sent to me for gas, and then $20 later when I needed it again. HOWEVER, I have tried over and over again without fail for WEEKS to login to my account and it claims that “Plaid”, whom they use to link your bank account, will not allow me to re-link my account. I have changed my bank password and logged into my bank, via their website, no problem at all, but every time I try to login to this app, it will not allow me. You cannot find contact information for them anywhere online. I did finally discover a place I could email them and I emailed them well wishing the 30 day “trial period” that I dislike the app function and wish to cancel my account. Never heard a flipping word back from the whatsoever and now they’ve charged me the $1.99 monthly fee, which is unethical, as I specifically requested to cancel the account before the trial period ever ended.  And, as an added surprise, that also makes zero sense, I opened the account in November 10-11, which means the charge should’ve come somewhere around December 10th, yet it charged on the 29th of December, giving me the impression for the past couple of weeks that it was successfully cancelled, despite their failure to respond to my request, then BAM, charged my account. Can an admin please respond to this and refund the $1.99 charge as well as CANCEL THE ACCOUNT. Very unprofessional this unresponsive nature.

"Hi I test apps and leave reviews for consumers for free cause the world is the world, this review is honest and mentions all personal experiences of using this app nothing is fabricated nor over exaggerated. Im not affiliated with any company.

Key Experience: this app will overdraft your account it doesn't pay its self back properly, days will pass before float attempts to take back borrowed funds this app is not practical 

Summary of app/ experience 

This app will allow you to withdraw money within your pay period for 1.99 a month. IMMEDIATE withdrawal comes with a $4 fee, FREE withdrawal takes 2-3 business days to reach your account. “Only” $10 or $20 are allowed to be withdrawn for a single period. you will be given an option to increase but that option will remain unavailable at the discretion of the developers. They tell you how your able to increase the balance but after tinkering with the different ways to increase I didn't receive one. After contacting the developers and asking for an increase in my balance I was ignored which seems to be the story of many here in the comments “ want more money, TO BAD pay me! There are requirements to withdraw funds early, such as having a balance above $0.00 and a positive payment history with float, they also require at least 3 consecutive deposits of no less than $200.00 and you cant have any large atm withdrawals after or prior to your payday. So if your in need for immediate financial help please go to recommendations or keep looking.

Wrap- up / recommendations 

These requirements seem normal for a company looking to lend money to strangers ;however, this app doesn't seem to fully fulfill its end of the deal. If your in need of an advancement in your paycheck with minimum hurdles my recommendation would be Earnin they
have a large burrow amount with little to no hassle in getting the funds they have similar requirements and they will charge you on the due date, no need to worry about random unforeseen overdrafts. Float just seems to operate completely autonomously with little human interactions in my opinion. developers are not fast with responding and the interface seems is to simple for a paycheck advancement app. Since installing the app theres been one updated but nothing but the app logo changed. I also get a sketchy vibe because the app states its a financial app but the resources they provide are mediocre everyday articles and opinions from unreliable sources, not to mention they don’t automatically pull what you borrow like they state and blame you for the mis hap . Float may just be a developer piggy banks

I have only been using this app for a few weeks now but so far it’s one of the best and easiest apps to get a few bucks in between paydays. The only thing that really stinks is that you can only get out 20 bucks at a time until you can prove yourself with this company but at least they give you an option to get more if needed in the future. I give this at five stars for the simple reason of it is help me twice already when I needed gas money and if you Astor dollars to get some groceries to take me over in between paydays.Signing up as simple connecting accounts is very simple and navigating the other simple and customer service is right there to help you if needed.

"I have emailed floatme support twice in the last three weeks, and have received no response. My bank was unlinked to floatme, and I cannot feline it, as it continues to tell. My username and password is incorrect even though it is not, and I’ve successfully rekindled my account on every other app. Only problem is here and no help is available. But they have no problem getting their 1.99 a month. 
Before this problem three weeks ago, I never had a problem with floatme. I’m very disappointed nobody will get back to me to help. 
I can’t get past the delink my account page",TwitterMe,8/28/2020 14:19,"{'id': 17632591, 'body': ""Hi TwitterMe, I unfortunately can't find an email or username that matches this; iOS doesn't post your email or contact info.

When I first downloaded the app and set everything up app worked fine. Once I got the first initial float of 20 it went fine. Paid the money back in the same week which was 24 since I got the instant transfer intstead of waiting app worked fine. Now when I open the app and login it goes straight to a grey screen and I’ve used my lte data to try and I’ve used WiFi as well and it continues to do the same thing and the App Store doesn’t say anything about an update for the app so it’s not an update the app type issue. I’m starting to think some fishy things are going on. I’m going to keep trying if it continues then that’s a reeeeal problem.
