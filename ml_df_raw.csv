Waste of time,2018-12-11 14:41:00,5,False,"I received  numerous emails and text on how I was approved for the $500. I entered in banking info and had to manually send in bank statement since it had to be verified. I was then told by representative , an email and text my bank passed the screening process and to continue with the next steps online, after re-verifying my banking  info as asked it stated my account/rousting number didn’t match. I called back after waiting on hold for 25 minutes and was told they support team updated it in the system and to retry. I did it again and now received error message my bank isn’t supported! I called back and was told my bank was verified and passed the process on their end but wasn’t sure why I was receiving error online. In the meantime I’m still receiving text and emails telling me I can proceed to get the money....long story short no one can assist with why or how the online system is blocking my banking info saying it’s not supported I was even told to try and use the MoneyLion checking account to have funds deposited by a representative and transferred to that department and after being on hold 30 minutes this time I was told the MoneyLion checking account hadn’t been open long enough! Complete run around for the past 2 weeks and to this day I’m still receiving offers to apply and that my bank passed the screening process.

Super excited thus far...,2018-01-13 15:04:34,5,False,"I downloaded the app and although there are issues like DL not scanning and the #growyourstack option doesn’t pan a flat surface, I was able to get everything else going. I was super skeptical, ESPECIALLY after reading all the reviews about high interests, unexpected “surprises”, and scams but if you, as a consumer, do you part and actually read a document, you will see exactly what are signing up for. I was approved for the loan at the 5.99%; they don’t even check your credit for it and their requirements for approval are clearly stipulated. I opened up the contract to make sure and I was happy to see that I was set up for payments according to my pay period and at a 5.99% APR. Had I seen something different, I wouldn’t have accepted the loan. I would recommend that you open docs and read them before agreeing to anything. I am looking forward to having the issues worked out so I can take 100% advantage of all MoneyLion’s functionality. Financial stability is very important to me. It is clear to me that MoneyLion knows that there is an enormous gap between basic financial knowledge and healthy finances and they are invested in bridging that gap to help those of us that haven’t made the best “financial” decisions. I will come back and update my review as time passes. I’m hoping to bump it to 5 stars and 2 big thumbs up!!",Nadezhada,
Great investment,2018-07-24 16:34:52,5,False,"So I’ve been a member for a full 30 days now. I was very skeptical at first, I wanted to cancel after my first payment because I read some negative reviews. But, thinking about the situation a little longer I realized all the negative reviews have one thing in common, and that’s because these people didn’t read the documents or what they were signing up for. So I left it at that! Now if you don’t have the money monthly to pay both the membership fees and the loan. Then I wouldn’t suggest this app, cause you need to spend money to make money, if you have no money then you can’t make any. Anyways, you pay a membership fee of $33 and some change every two weeks. $50 of that goes into your investment account. That is STILL your money! It’s just in a savings account for you basically. ML couldn’t verify my bank account so I was in something called the LOANLocked group. I had to make sure to pay my membership ON TIME, auto-drafted from my bank account. 30 days later with no questions asked I was approved without running my credit for the $500 loan. I don’t have this app just for the loan. I have it to build my credit, and the ongoing investment. I would recommend this app to my close family and friends because I trust it. AGAIN READ what you’re signing up for.  ☺️☺️☺️☺️",Rosslynn N.,
Will not help credit run away!!!!,2019-11-24 01:54:12,1,False,I got this app and account as it says if you log in each day you don’t have to pay for the services. I also got the $500 loan to help with increase my credit. This bank only works with a few of the major banks so only my one account that I used for online transactions would work. The major pain is they take 6-7 day’s to process a transaction. It takes 2-3 days before it is taken out of your bank and then some times another 5-7 days to show up on your account as having the loan payment made. I had it set up for automatic payment but even that took 5-7 days and would show that my payment was late due to the lag in the processing of the payment. I contacted there non existent customer service and was sent to there team and services page with zero help. So basically you pay $19 a month to have access to a $500 loan. The loan was easy but the issues with the account and no ability to make payments through bank accounts that do not link through there site such as a ACH or direct withdrawal you can not use checks or anything to make payments and they take so long to clear this app has now actually hurt my credit. 2 of the months they took longer due to the payment coming out over a weekend they had already reported the payment as late before they processed it. This is a scam please do you fall for this like I did. I have paid back the loan and plan to cancel my membership as soon as possible. Also they will not give you back your money in any way.,KrisAndrae,"{'id': 13426858, 'body': ""Hi there! I'm sorry to hear about your experience with MoneyLion.

It’s really a 5 Star,2019-01-14 19:53:28,5,False,"I would have given MoneyLion a 5 star rating if it wasn’t for the verification system they have in place. But I can also blame them for the glitches because customer service seems to know what’s going on but doesn’t come right out to tell you, and that makes the verification go on for weeks. If some would have taken the time to explain I would have given 5 stars. After answering about 4 questions about myself which I answered CORRECTLY the computer told me I was wrong and I would get another try, the second time the same thing my answer were ALL CORRECT but there was no third try it told me I had to wait a week then reapply for the checking account which gives you a lot more options when it comes to borrowing money. Which in a sense is ur own money. But what gets me is why not just tell me I’m not eligible for the checking but I’m ok for the investment part which I really like and think it’s an Awesome way to save & invest at the same time. I wish I could get the checking account that would complete my portfolio! I still recommend investing it’s worth it, now and for the future!!! BeeMan",BeeBoi,
Great money maker/investment/credit builder,2019-01-13 22:42:58,4,False,"I took a chance with ml for the loan opportunity and I'm so glad I did. From the low interest rate on the loan I received, to the opportunity for financial growth by earning a dollar a day to build on my investment just for opening up the app and swiping, all the way to helping me build my credit I have to say the decision I made to take a chance was actually one of the best decisions I've made in regards to finances. I do however need to let it be known I am not so happy with my ml checking account, I opened the account because it said free checking account and over 55,000 free atm's but yet the first time I used my card to withdraw money out of an atm I was charged twice one charge was the typical $2 atm fee from the atm's financial institution but then I saw when I was looking at my ml checking account transactions that I was also charged $2.50 from ml as well on top of the $2 atm fee I had already paid. I should not have had to pay a fee to ml as well as pay one to the financial institution of the atm I withdrew from! Now I worry every time I need to make a purchase hesitating and debating on whether or not to use my ml card wondering if I'll be charged for doing so. That is something I should never have to worry about from my personal bank account/institution especially if you were told prior to opening it it's a free account.",dgirl0220,
Hassles Upon Hassles,2019-04-11 22:01:57,2,False,"I liked the app at first, and I enjoy saving money and being able to request a loan when needed.

However, the customer service for this company is pathetic, and so is the system the billing is under as well. The first time I called the person I was speaking to didn't even sound like he wanted to be there, gave me the wrong information that, had I NOT requested to speak to a supervisor (who also sounded bored and condescending) it could have been a choice that damaged my credit. 

Today I call, because I'm willing to pay off my loan. Using a bank account takes way too long and at this point, I'm ready to pay off and cancel due to the hold time and the wait customer service has. I finally get through to someone after a whopping 15 minutes (and fake clicking links on the website to contact support) for them to tell me my card is not supported to pay my loan off in full. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the BANK ACCOUNT is literally attached to that card & vice versa, how can one be supported and the other isn't ? The bank account takes too long to clear and it completely ruins the plan I had since I'm on vacation. I don't even want the membership anymore, cause there's way too many aspects to this membership and it seems that not everyone is skilled or knowledgeable on it which makes it even MORE confusing, to then have this issue with my billing I'm completely turned off.

"Garbage app, customer service is trash and clueless on there own products",2020-08-19 21:08:03,2,False,Ever since I’ve been upgraded to the Roar Money account it’s been a nightmare. There’s been issues with MoneyLion in the past but this about does it. I upgraded to this new account and was encouraged to switch all of my direct deposits to it. A few problems with this. One it would not give me the option to make this my account to make my membership payments so last month it caused a missed payment which I fixed by transferring some money over from my MoneyLion Roar account to my old MoneyLion account and did a manual payment to my MoneyLion membership. This month same thing happened except this time even though my old MoneyLion account does expire for over a week the option to transfer from my Roar MoneyLion account to the old MoneyLion account so I could pay off the missed membership payment. So I had to call in and a representative switched the payments over for me to my MoneyLion Roar account and I paid the missed membership payment. I even paid the remaining balance in full for my MoneyLion loan. I was told the freeze on my account was gonna be lifted and than the call dropped. No call back so I called in again and this time I’m being told my account even though paid off is still suspended for 3-5 business days so I’m unable withdraw my investments or apply for a new loan.

Great but the tip portion is ridiculous and needs more info,2020-02-19 18:12:20,3,False,"I can honestly say I love this app. Hands down really great at looking at all your money at once. There’s an option to invest, but it doesn’t explain anything about the investing. You have no idea what your invested in and what’s happening with that money. Also, you don’t have the option to take that money back if you no longer want to invest, which is a little ridiculous. The credit building is great, it reports to the credit bureau appropriately and you see the impact quickly. However, the instacash option is ridiculous. When you take out an instacash it constantly asks for a tip. I don’t mind leaving a tip for the help but if you don’t leave a tip your amount of instacash lessens, like a punishment for not paying more. Finally the last complaint would be the cashback shake that they offer. It’s a fun little option and it doesn’t give much back which isn’t an issue. The issue is that you can’t choose where that cashback goes. It immediately goes to the investment, which again you know nothing about. There should be an option of putting the cashback in the checking or in the investment. Overall a good app and great tool for improving credit and having some extra cash here and there but it needs some improvement.",Grace121595,"{'id': 13613780, 'body': 'Hi Grace121595!

What a waste,2019-03-01 16:01:18,1,False,"I have been using money lion for pretty close to a year. Never had any issues until lately. I contact customer service to let them know that they are drafting my membership fees and loan payments on opposite weeks that I get paid and to please correct it. That was back in October. Never got done. After being charged multiple nsf fees from my bank I called them again, yet they have no record of me calling. I try to look past it cause everyone makes mistakes. I get my direct deposit sent here and that is when al the real issues start. There as too many bugs. I log in ever single day. I never miss. Yet since they had to change my payment dates which they finally did the customer service rep that I spoke to assured me that I would still get my 50 dollars back into my account. Not true. Even though they still took the payment out of my direct deposit the following day ( my direct deposit is set is with them) so they can see my deposits they paused my membership so that they could keep my 50 dollars. As soon as my taxes get here I will be paying off my loan and direct deposit. Too many bugs. Customer service supervisors just lie to get you off the phone. It says that I need to finish setting up my account with direct deposit all the time even though it is set up already. Today it says that it can’t verify my bank information even though they are my bank.

FRAUDS!  STAY AWAY FROM MONEYLION!,2020-07-23 07:15:14,1,False,"MoneyLion fraudulently opened two separate accounts in my name with two different social security numbers.   They opened a $500 Credit builder PLUS loan in my name without my knowledge, authorization, consent or approval. They forced me to pay that loan off even after I filed a police report which backed my identity theft claim, complaints with the CFPB, BBB, The NY State Attorney General’s office, and the FTC.  They reported this to the credit report which is how I found out about it.  The bank they had on file is not a bank I have ever done business with.  They are SCAM artists and they are frauds.  DO NOT do any business with them.  They are nearly impossible to talk to on the phone, they don’t care that they have fraudulent accounts, and refuse to follow the laws on the United States to correct this.  

They owe me a lot of money and they said that they already paid it.  That’s a lie.  Then they said their “engineers” had to review and release the $375 escrow funds (that I never opened in the first place but was required to pay off) within 5 days, yet the haven’t.  I want a refund of all monies paid to protect my credit because they are full of crap.  This company is a bunch of scam artists and their call center is based out of Malaysia.

When I checked why it changed it was bc my minor child’s bank acct had a deposit of money. Her acct is linked to mine for management reasons only! I do not have access to her monies. Her acct is under her social and her name. Money lion initiated a repayment from her acct without authorization! That’s stealing! That’s not the acct or debit card I signed up with and they should not be able to steal money from other peoples accts just bc they’re linked!

If it was legitimate....,2019-01-15 11:27:03,1,False,"So everything was totally great, then my monthly payments weren’t coming out each week. I called numerous times the first time they didn’t go through and couldn’t get through. When I finally did they tell me I was in “default collection” just 2 days past my due date because my bank account number to take the payments out were wrong (but not wrong to put the money in my account mind you) so they make up a “new payment plan” and instead of 52 weeks pay off I have now a 12 week pay off as “punishment”. I negotiated to 16 telling him I put the right account number in (he even read off the right number to me) and begrudgingly accepted. Then I wait the next week for the payments to come out and they don’t. Instead I get an email this time (the first time I had to track them down) and it says “broken promises” as the headline and that my account number was incorrect and they couldn’t take the payment out. This was after 56 minutes on the phone (a recorded line) with a rep to fix my “issue” the first time. 
I knew the terms and agreements I read it I knew I’d have to pay that wasn’t the issue, but this company is literally pushing people into paying more and lying about how they’re doing it.

IF YOU NEED ADVICE Before getting this app,2019-04-07 17:58:04,4,False,"When i first got this bank i was excited i was accepted for MoneyLion after i entered all my personal info i was given access to the app they ask you if you want to join the MEMBERSHIP they give you different pay options on how to pay it ,they even ask you to link your bank account you already have . DONT BE WORRIED !!:) they’re a bank they need this stuff to help you operate. You can get access to a 500$ loan . I couldn’t get the loan right away which made me think this was dumb but it said i was on a lock down sorta thing . You have to check into the app every day to unlock the 500$ loan for about 30 days and after it’s GUARANTEED I PROMISE YOU how you spend it is in you just remember ITS A LOAN IT AFFECTS YOUR CREDIT AND HELPS BUILD CREDIT.

Buggy and disappointing,2020-08-17 15:24:51,3,False,"There is consistently lots of bugs in this app and I’ve had it for over a year now. I pay for a MoneyLion premium membership and the credit advice feature has never worked for me. It freezes up the app after answering the security questions. The flow of the app is not logical. Making the smallest changes like an address change is even a difficult process. All MoneyLion users were recently forced to switch from MoneyLion checking to a Roar Money account. In doing so, we had to let our MoneyLion accounts close after opening the Roar Money account. We now pay a monthly fee as well. I used to schedule money transfers from my Wells Fargo account to MoneyLion twice a month, and I tried to link my WF account to this new Roar Money account and it shows that it does not qualify for transfers with WF. I’m super disappointed. I really liked my MoneyLion account and now I’m paying for an account I can’t even make transfers to or find an ATM for. It’s a hassle. I’m trying to close the RoarMoney account I just opened and I can’t find where to do that, just like everything else in the app. There is not a phone number to call or a chat to get help.

THIEVES! STAY AWAY,2018-11-30 01:44:09,1,False,This company is absolute garbage. I took out the 500 dollar loan and paid it off early. I called to cancel my membership and ask to liquidate my investment account. The guy said I will have my money in 7-10 business days. I call them 7 business days later to check up on my money. They say that no liquidation request was made (I made sure when talking to the guy originally that it would be liquidated and in my account in 7-10 business days). So I asked to speak to a supervisor who said he personally submitted the liquidation request and I would receive my money in 7-10 business days. I call them 7 business days later to check on the status and they tell me that the liquidation is in process and the money should be in my account in 3-5 business days. So I wait 5 business days and call today. The guy said that the liquidation is still in process and doesn’t know what is going on but he will send a message to the higher ups to see what is going on. It has now been a month since I originally canceled my account and still haven’t gotten my money. They’re just giving me the run-around like the other reviews I have read stated.

Subpar in comparison,2020-02-15 06:10:47,1,True,"Update: I wasn’t impressed with MoneyLion at all. A complete rip off. The latest annoyance with this app is it won’t let you remove any bank account/card information even without a membership. I’ve called you can’t get through and I’ve emailed and of course no response.  I would think twice before downloading the app!!!!!

Compared to other cash advance apps (Brigit & Earnin) MoneyLion is a joke.  With  Brigit you pay $10 a month and I can borrow 250 biweekly.  It’s not instant but within a day or two I get the money.  Earnin there isn’t a membership fee you just tip what you feel is right ... I can get it into my account instantly and borrow upto 1000 a month. MoneyLion has you pay a membership fee to borrow... 10 dollars ok cool. Then it takes 3-5 days for the money to hit your account. Ok that’s not the quick help you’re possibly hoping for but if you pay another 5 dollars per amount you borrow it can be instant. Ok fine but you’re already losing to the other two apps now. Then right before you get the cash advance they want you to tip. I’m sorry I’m lost what the heck am I tipping for???? I’ve already paid a membership fee and a fee so I can see it before 5 days.  Then if you chose not to tip you get multiple other messages about how you need to.

MoneyLion displays itself as the go-to app for all of your banking needs, but increasingly falls short of expectations. After being denied the “Instacash” offer, I was told I would have to wait 7 days to even be approved for cash advances, but it failed to tell me where I went wrong. Was it my lack of information, or did something go wrong with the bank it already approved? I’ll never know, and with my bills coming up in 5 days, it’ll be too little, too late. Image facing punitive measures for a failure on your banks part. If this were any other bank, I would withdraw my money, and take it somewhere else, so that’s what intend to do. If you can’t help when you’re needed like you said you could, what is your point of being on my phone?

I love MoneyLion😍,2018-07-19 01:00:16,5,False,"I absolutely love MoneyLion it is a legitimate resource for saving and a legitimate source for a loan!! I started using MoneyLion in May and have already been able to save almost 300$ now I know 300 doesn’t sound like much but considering the fact the my savings account would always show zero I count this as a win, also in addition to the investment account, I was able to get a 500 dollar loan the next business day with NO hassle, of course you need proof of income and ID but that’s pretty much all they asked for so as long as you have a legitimate bank account a source of income with direct deposit and A government issued ID you will get a loan!!! And they are easy to payback my loan only charges me about 19 dollars every payday now this app does cost 79 a month but 50 dollars of that automatically goes into your investment account so it’s your money it’s kind of like a forced savings which I don’t think is horrible, and you get one dollar everyday that you login so the app is really free if you are logical lol but other than that don’t be hesitant to give it a try!!!

First of all, your emails will be replied to from a generic account so you literally can’t follow up with the same person. Also, no one has ever responded to my replies to a request for more info on an issue. So I will email about something, get a reply, then respond and literally no response thereafter. Every time. Also, calls to sales reps always seem to go well, but when they escalate you may or may not hear back from a manager. I was told that there was clearly no direct deposit pattern even though I have a direct deposit of $4200 every month on the last day of the month happen. How that isn’t clear I do not know. And that was a managers response. The poor people at the call center, good luck if you can find that phone number, are genuinely good people but given no power by a company that screws its customers.

Recently just paid off $1000 credit plus loan now shows i owe two missed payments made two weeks ago from my account and by card. Errors all i get when i try to submit payment using my cards on file. Saying to contact my bank. What they dont tell is the loan isnt the full amount. Lucky to get at $175 then you paying them payments. Once paid the full loan amount you get reserve funds credit to your account. Basically I apply for $1000 and get $175 and the $825 will get once the full $1000 is paid plus APR fees and membership fees. Contact support takes for every by phone. And thru emails after a day your ticket request is canceled or closed. Only report on my credit shows every time they didnt take a payment from the account on file.

Worst Loan EVER !!,2020-04-01 14:59:29,1,False,"They approve you for credit builder plus, but give you only a portion of that money and keep the rest in “reserve”. Once you pay the WHOLE $1000 plus interest THEN you can get what they’re holding from you. What they dont tell you is it takes 5 business days to get that money transferred after you pay off your loan which takes 5-7 business days to clear might i add before the loan is paid off. They hold your money for 2 weeks after paying off a loan. You email them and no one can give you a good answer. Then they charge the membership fee of $4.6 weekly if you have a loan out with them (its required). Ive never had such difficulties with a loan company actually giving me my money. I paid off my loan going on 2 weeks and i have yet to get the money i had in reserves myself. If you need a loan. Go somewhere else. Anywhere else. They couldnt possibly hit you with this many problems and fees.

Update - Called to ask why i STILL dont have my money from my reserve that i paid my loan off 2 weeks ago. Their response was that cancelling my MoneyLion Plus ($4.60 weekly) slowed down the process and now its going to take ANOTHER 2-4 business days to trasnfer funds.

Moneylion Membership,2019-12-28 18:06:29,5,False,"After carefully reviewing, and downloading the moneylion app, it has come to my attention that money lion will still charge you for the membership fees, even if the original bank account you linked up to money lion is no longer active. I have been having problems with this app for months, just dragging my credit score down. My original score was excellent, and now it has dropped to being fair.. it’s all because of the way moneylion handles its payments. It’s hard to get in contact with this company, and even harder trying to pay them back.  Do yourself a favor and save yourself the troubles. They offer you a $500 loan, and the membership is supposed to help you with your credit, yet it’s very difficult to continue to make payments.

Fabulous investment account!,2019-03-22 09:19:30,5,False,"As a “loan app” this is not ideal. If you need a quick $500, it will probably be pretty hard to invest $79 per month. I have absolutely been there financially, and people need to understand that this is first and foremost an investment app, Not an easy loan opportunity. Just like with any investment account, once you put your money in, it will take some time to get it back out, because your investments need to be sold on the market. Not a great way to save money if you think you will need immediate access to that money. I haven’t personally use the checking and loan features, but it’s really nice to know they’re there, and they are a step above the other options out there. Like I said, this is primarily an investment account, as if you go pro, you will be spending $79 per month on investments. Make sure you check the app every single day! The “fee” is easy to recoup by checking the app every day, and sometimes you even end up ahead if you were diligent (31 days in a month X $1/day - $29 fee = $2 ahead!).",Waiting. . .,

Now my credit took a major hit because money lion is reporting that I’m not making payments, when in all reality they are not excepting any of my payments, through the app I’m not neglecting the terms of my loan nor my membership fees, it simply does not process. Now when I go to the app there aren’t any options to pay off the rest of my loan, it says payments was fulfilled in July when I was supposed to complete the payments in December.

MoneyLion has me excited about saving!!,2018-01-05 18:16:44,5,False,"So glad that I found MoneyLion! This app finally has me excited about saving. The MoneyLion Plus program automatically invests money for you each month and offers opportunities to earn “cash back” just for logging into the app everyday. The money is deducted from your funding source based on your pay period, these smaller reoccurring amounts make saving way less daunting. MoneyLion Plus also offers low interest rate loans with easy approval when you need funds without having to withdraw from your investment savings account. The loan payments are reasonable and are deducted automatically in occurrence with your pay day. In addition, they also offer a reward program that allows you to earn points that can be redeemed for gift cards for doing things as simple as completing your profile or enrolling in their free credit monitoring program.

I offered to pay the $12 and was told I don’t have to worry about paying it because I’m no longer eligible for instacash. I received no notice of any negative balance for an entire year, and no communication was made regarding the new decision to base instacash payments on prior MoneyLion account activity. Had I know any of this, I could have paid the $12. I’m not sure how a charge was even made on an account that should have been closed due to the switch over.

If you are approved for 120 dollars you can only take 50 at at time so you pay transaction fees, tips, same day deposit fees for each one. So if you want the 120 dollars in your account ASAP you have to pay 3.99 transaction fee for each transaction. One for 50, transaction fee. Another for 50, a transaction fee. The remaining 20, a transaction fee. So that’s 12 dollars in fees plus the tips they try to shame you into giving.

App use to have a clear directive,2019-07-21 06:16:56,1,False,"I downloaded and took the loan before the update. The app use to force you to save and invest money by your pay period and also give your money back with daily logins. Now the app has transitioned over to a flat monthly fee. I feel scammed as now the app no longer invests the money. Zero fee checking doesn’t exist since I now have to pay a weekly fee? None of my money is invested anymore, and the 5.99% apr loan isn’t realistically 5.99 percent. At $20 a month that loan transitions to a ridiculous 60% apr loan. I used the app to slowly invest money and don’t appreciate the mid transition as I agreed to the loan on different terms. I don’t understand the point of the app anymore. The app doesn’t make it a priority to invest anymore. Now im paying a monthly fee to hold on to a credit building loan with a ridiculous payout from my pocket that I never agreed to when I first took the loan. I’ll end up paying a ridiculous amount of money for the rest of my loan because of this change with no benefit. I wish they’d bring back the forced auto save and get rid of the new membership fee.

Highly recommend,2021-02-19 00:23:05,5,False,I started using MoneyLion this past year when I got a job that does direct deposit. (My previous job was a mom and pop restaurant) what made me start using this bank was the instacash option they have. Basically it’s an advancement that will come out of your next check. You do have to pay a fee for using the service but I think that’s fair as they need to make money as well. Just be aware that you will need to have the direct deposit active and going into the account for a month or so I believe. You can unlock up to $250 a pay depending on how you pay back the most previous advance. They also these “boosts” which is where they will give you an extra amount on certain things. For example they gave $25 extra for valentines. They also offer a credit builder loan up to $1000 for anyone needing to repair their credit or build it. Those payments are automatically deducted from your deposit. I think this is an amazing bank.

Honest review,2020-05-23 15:55:35,1,False,"I think most people who rate this app 4 stars or more are only referring to the Loan they just received and how quickly they got the money, which I would say is understandable. But after months of being a member with MONEYLION, I have experienced a troubling amount of bad customer service. On top of that,  it’s not easy to reach them if you have any issues.  For some reason they can’t even call my actual phone number and I have to use a Google Number for verification that I set up.  When you finally can reach them, it’s never an American, which is cool. The only problem is that while I can understand every they say, they can’t under me.  It’s super frustrating.  But most importantly, I’m still getting charged after I’m no longer a member.  Guys, customer service is PRICELESS.  The most trusted companies have that part taken care of.  But not MONEYLION. If they happen to double charge you or claim that the bank won’t let them take the money out even though money is clearly there, good luck with having that issue resolved.

Thieves,2020-01-08 14:46:13,1,False,"I downloaded this app and joined MoneyLion plus due to a friend telling me about the app. This is definitely one of the worst things I could have ever did. Not only is it hard to get in contact with customer service due to the new phone prompts, their app has too many issues and they never report your on time payments to the 3 major credit bureaus like they claim to do. Every time I log into the app it says my payment failed and asks me to resubmit the payment, but I’ll see the payment pending in my bank account already so how could it have failed especially with there being more than enough money available in my account? I joined in October and it is now January and only one payment has been reported since, but they claim to report every 30 days! This app is a rip off. I’m fine with you taking $20 every pay period for the loan payment but why are you taking $10 every pay period for the membership as well? I thought it was $10/mo not every 2 weeks which would really make the membership 20/mo so in total you’re taking $60/mo from me. I’m about to go ahead and just pay this loan off in full because it’s definitely NOT worth the headache!

Unsatisfied,2020-04-24 13:44:22,1,False,I have been a moneylion plus member for almost 2 years I’ve received multiple $500 loans and now I’ve reach the point of a $1000 credit builder loan. Now that I am trying to apply it’s stating an error message “bank connection not supported” or something like that statement. They need to be able to verify my income and bank transaction which they were able to do for the previous loans I have taken out through them and now all of a sudden my bank isn’t connected. I called several time yesterday I was hung up on by one rep. And the other 2 reps were acting as if they couldn’t hear me but I had great service and I could hear them clearly. The last person I spoke to tried to be of more help and stated she would put in a “ticket” to the technical support team to see if this issue can be resolved. If in fact it is not resolved I will be liquidating my investment and canceling my membership. This is absolutely ridiculous and due to COVID-19 I am in need of the loan I am eligible for and now after paying for these services for 2 years I’m unable to receive the funds due to a banking glitch in their system. I am unhappy with the service and also the customer service reps are truly unprofessional and unsympathetic.,badbusiness88,"{'id': 14897089, 'body': ""Hi there!

I am in my twenties and I had my child early so I really want to create a financial path to support the lifestyle I desire to have for him. Money Lion not only helps me monitor my credit and build, but it helps me understand how and why certain behaviors drive specific results. I love the Money Lion plus as well. I have always wanted to invest you hear so much money can be made that way but I’ve never been good at math and it just seemed too difficult to manage. I don’t even think about it I check the app see what involved and if I choose to I will read up to see what is happening so far $200 and rising. My credit score has gone up 70 POINTS IN 3 Months.

I spent 3 days trying to find an actual customer service number to call and when I finally found one and got someone on the phone I was told unless I hold a bank account that they approve for three months minimum with a positive balance I cannot get money lion plus and get my loan . Even though it states online in their facts section that u just need to have MoneyLion plus and may have to wait up to 30 days before u can get your loan processed.

Good intention but a hot mess.,2018-09-15 13:51:56,1,False,"I was in a bind in regards to my finances and decided that MoneyLion was the outlet for a short-term resolution. As a FINRA licensed representative it was already a catastrophe when they “require” you to invest a portion of your money in their brokerage options. Later I decided to pay a lump-sum amount towards the loan that was never applied. I was then reported delinquent to the credit bureau when I continuously made on time payments. I was promised every time that the issue was resolved when it wasn’t. I finally decided it was time to pay the loan off in full and close the account after the unfortunate reports to Transunion. The money was never taken to payoff the loan,
Which then resulted in me calling them. I was then told that due to their new ACH system
That my payment would not be cleared and that I had to make a payment through my debit card. This would have not been an issue if it was relayed to that there was en error instead of waiting several days. I finally decided to close my account and liquidate everything.

Whatever happened to truth in advertising,2019-04-16 17:41:49,2,False,I begin my MoneyLion membership last year. I missed a payment so they passed my money line plus membership which meant I was not going to receive the one dollar a day no matter how much I logged in. I understood that. Sent a payment which was withdrawn from my account on February 27. It took them until March 7 to post it. March 15 I should’ve been able to start getting my one dollar a day for logging in. I have logged in every day since March 15 and only received one dollar. I contacted customer service which is a big joke. Supervisors lie. Oh it’s being escalated. Email them only to find out there is an open ticket so wait 3 to 5 business days. I have been calling every Monday sense March 11 and still no resolution. What makes them think I’m supposed to pay $79 a month and they get to keep $29 of my money? It May not seem like much but that’s 353  A year which I could definitely find a better use for blowing.

Horrible Customer Service!!,2020-03-06 04:27:28,1,False,"Please save yourself the headache, don’t bank with Money Lion. I honestly wish I could give them negative stars. 

I have had this account for a few months now. At first everything was great, I set up direct deposit and was able receive instcash. My account and debit card has been locked for 4 days now. No notification, text message, phone call, or email was sent to me to let me know this was taking place (my card kept declining, I have over $1,000 in my account). After finally being able to speak to a customer service representative (I was on hold for 20 minutes), I was told my address needed to be verified and I had to send bank statements with my address on it. 

I have sent over the documents and have not received any update. I called earlier today and was told my account was unlocked, it’s not. I currently have over $1,000 my account that I have no access to and don’t know when I will be able to access it. Can’t even pay my bills.

Updated: Hate the new plus membership,2019-07-08 11:16:52,1,False,"Dropped from 3 to 1 stars. Everything was already “just okay” and now I can’t earn my membership fee back as cash back anymore. Doesn’t link to my preferred bank, now it’s not going to let me earn back my fees and has given no indication of what “lions share payments” will be when I already distrust them. I don’t even need the loans or the credit monitoring I was just making it a nifty little habit to invest a dollar a day. Do I am going to close my account and keep up the habit of investing a dollar a day in Aspiration’s redwood fund. 

Previous review: Everything is just okay.  Moneylion is a good way to build some minor investments and build good habits over time by checking your info daily.  And I stash some money in the checking account here and there.  I already have online checking savings and investment accounts through Aspiration and it will not link to my bank so only my husband’s account info is imported so nothing is really accurate about my financial heartbeat. I suspect this is possibly because Aspiration is a competitor, and this suspicion is the main reason I haven’t set up a direct deposit with this account.

I used to be happy with them,2020-01-06 15:45:27,2,False,I was very happy with money lion when I first started with the app. I grew my investment account to almost 500 dollars (awesome!) got a 500 loan that WAS NEVER LATE until the last three months of my loan I switched banks . I tried to switch in the app numerous times and tried to call. It wasn’t until they tried to send my account to collections that I finally could get someone on the phone. They ended up using my Investment money to pay the remaining Loan balance off. Which was fine but what really annoys me is that I tried to use my correct bank info to make this not even get this far and I got penalized because I couldn’t reach someone until it was to late.  I figure I’ll give money lion another chance because that was the only real issue I had. Well now I can’t get another loan because of “poor performance” with money lion something I had no control over.  I really had enjoyed investing and the loan service but now I wouldn't even recommend the app to anyone because money lion showed me they couldn’t rectify this situation that I literally could not control due to poor customer service,jegett,"{'id': 12778618, 'body': ""Hi!

Steer clear unless you’re in the upper echelons of society,2019-10-04 19:28:15,1,False,"Currently on hold for an hour and 5 minutes, attempting to close out a debt that is now accruing 5.99% interest DAILY. If your financial picture is perfect, MoneyLion can work for you. If you’re a member of the working class and fall behind, they will give you the run around when attempting to resolve issues. 

They don’t call back when you put your number in the list for a representative to call you back. After 30 minutes you are given the false option to continue waiting after they attempt to force you to sign up to be called back. I hit the option to continue waiting and was routed to debit card activation (???). The system then hung up on me after giving me no options to continue waiting.  From the beginning my call WAS routed to loan resolution. Unfortunately I can’t just pay in the app because it doesn’t reflect the balance of what I actually owe, so I have to sit around waiting to get on with my life. 

Other reviews seem to reflect this experience of getting the run around when attempting to do anything with MoneyLion. Know exactly what you’re getting into and hope nothing unexpected happens to you.",Diddly Teebleton,
Absolutely quintessential with one minor problem,2019-03-13 00:59:37,4,False,"This is by far the best money management app and do not take my four out of five star review as a sign that there is any detriment or defect on the platform that should deter you from using it because anybody who is not interested in this platform is clearly fiscally irresponsible and needs to get their priorities in order.

MoneyLion help transition me from the mid-20s hipster to the early 30s or rather late 20s soon to be 30 adult by Teaching me how money management is a crucial aspect of life something that my educators in all my years of learning in my post graduate degree never thought would be important for me to know. Either that or they didn’t care. How unprofessional & foolish of them. 

The only reason why I didn’t give this app a five star review was because It’s not quite there yet meaning it has certain flaws such as subpar customer service & support. Their team is rude, unprofessional and sometimes inadequate. Other than that this program has been a lifesaver and I am grateful for it.",Ahmad tarabichi,

Thank you,2020-04-30 17:29:06,5,False,I want to give a special thanks to the agent I spoke to I don’t remember the name but I was a little stressed but finally got through. A little bit of advice for people having issues with using all the resources they give. Ask to speak to someone in the states if you don’t agree ask to speak to a supervisor and request to speak to an agent in United States.  They will get your issues resolved . You have to understand this account is meant to help you save not spend. This is an investment account and there monthly member payments have gone down extremely at $9.99 . If you have the worst credit in the world it’s a pretty good deal  don’t make the minimum payment that’s why they want two payments in one month. The interest is based on the loan so just pay the most you can to get a history of better payments in your file. A lot of people are advised to take small loans out to build their credit .,babywavez,
Caution Monthly Fee,2019-08-12 12:50:54,3,False,"I took out the credit builder loan June of 2019. So far I’ve been paying on time. Have yet to receive a score boost to any of my credit unions. Let’s address the monthly fee at $20 a month and a year to pay back the loan, you’ll be paying almost $240 in fees. You’ll be paying back $740 from a principal of $500!! That sounds a lot like interest to me and is a bit ridiculous. I’m waiting to see if my payments will be added to my credit report. So far I’ve only just be alerted that it hit my credit report in the beginning of August even though I’ve had it since June. This alert was to make it known that the installment loan was added to my account, not that I’ve made on-time payments. Please know that you will be paying $20 a month so each time the payment is retrieved twice a month you’ll also be paying $9. The delivery of the loan was speedy and painless. $500 for someone with a credit score like mine is a tremendous help, I must admit. But please only use this if you really need it.

Good at first,2018-07-25 07:32:19,3,False,"It’s good borrowing and investing with money lion, but making a payment is so hard when the automatic ACH transfer doesn’t go through. I tried to change my account to pay it but it still does it on my old account and got charged a lot of overdraft fees. Now i have to pay a lot of fees. I wish they make options where you can pay from your debit card so it’s faster. And they won’t let you pay a different amount if it’s not in full amount, it’s either you pay the monthly or pay in full. Can’t customize how much you want to pay in between the minimum and the full amount. I can’t also use my investment money to pay off my loan even if the numbers are obviously going to work out. This app is good, but in my situation, it’s not working out. I’m going to work on paying this off so i can cancel and move on with my life.

Great for credit building,2018-08-30 11:36:38,5,False,"My advice, read the documents to determine if this is the right app for you. It isn’t for everyone. Some people that complain just want the $500 loan with no strings attached. That isn’t how this works. You are investing money into a “savings account” each month, while, if you sign into the app everyday, you get a free membership. If you are a little disciplined and you lose your streak, then you don’t get a free membership. They tell you when they are going to withdraw money for the app, investment account AND your loan payment, so it shouldn’t be a shock every month. Some of the negative comments......are people that are upset that they have to pay money back they borrowed and they want things for free. In one month, my score has gone up 25 points. I still have a long way to go, but MoneyLion is helping me get there. Don’t listen to the negative people, this is a great credit building app.",HalsBop,

Don’t.,2019-08-03 06:00:47,1,False,"MoneyLion was supposed to help me out with financial struggles, but instead they added to them exponentially. If you use the service, pray that you don’t ever have any issue, as customer service is a joke. My pay day changed during my membership, and they refused to change the day that they took from my bank account. Instead of taking out the same day my direct deposit hit, they were taking out the day before. This overdrew my account multiple times. They refused to help. As such, I decided to cancel my plus membership. This however took over a month. I had a small outstanding amount on my $500 loan and paid it all at once. While the money was taken from my account one business day later, it did not “process” in MoneyLion’s system for nearly two full weeks. This was two weeks of membership fees being taken out, again still on the wrong day. Once my membership was finally cancelled, I still paid a membership fee for a week.

I love that they don’t have fees for overdrafts or returned checks or any fees at that, plus there instacash loan feature is amazing. I’ve recently been approved for the credit builder plus loan because I have a mother source of income in a foreign account that was eligible for this feature and it’s helped my credit put! The only thing is I use this as my primary checking account but I can’t keep track of none of my expenses for example like Bank of America, it would be great if that feature was implemented into the app, it would give a lot more usability for the average user, such as myself!

Scam.,2019-07-18 16:50:13,1,True,"Make sure you realize they you must maintain a membership the entire time you have a loan. You can also not use saved money to pay off a loan as there an equation to how much money you can take out while having a loan. So if you owe 300 and have over 300 in their investment account you can’t use any of it. So if at any point you can’t afford membership fees, they demand you have to or they will submit your membership debt to a credit agency. While also not being able to touch the hundreds you have in their investment account. So make sure you can afford to pay full membership for the entirety of your loan period and don’t expect to use your investment savings to pay it off. To me that’s very scammy. They didn’t even respond to the BBB which rates them poorly.

Their help was basically useless and hung up on me. Their last response to my last review was a broken link.

All in all until they create a solution for this issue I will continue to think it’s a scam. You should be able to remove your investment money whenever you want, you should at the very least be allowed to pay off your loan with it.",Justwool,"{'id': 9710355, 'body': ""Hi there, sorry to hear you're not happy with your experience with MoneyLion.

It was supposed to be reflected on their account within a few business days. It has almost been two weeks. They asked me to submit bank statements as proof saying it showed it was never paid.

Well I actually did have that amount on Sunday morning , but now on Sunday night I only have 130 out of 160 avajlabke? Why do you keep changing the amount? This has never happened before...

I did a little digging and it looks like my original base amount - before the booots were applied - got lowered from 170 to 155 even though I’ve had a few “good behavior” boosts so I’m not sure why the amount is being lowered again and and I don’t even get a warning or notification.

Be wary,2020-01-18 13:14:00,2,False,I love the idea of what the app does in addition to giving you an opportunity to build your credit through a small loan. BE WARY. I fell on hard times and was unable to pay the loan back within their timeframe( but it was definitely paid) so instead of working with me they kept charging for a membership that I couldn’t use because I was behind on payments and then at the end of it all after the loan was paid they tried to say I owed them an additional $1500+ for a membership I had no access to. The worst part is that they are reposting negatively on my credit even though this loan was paid off 3 months ago every month they re report it as a new loan and it keeps bringing my score down and they refuse to do anything about it I have called in on multiple occasions and they say they are going to fix the problem and then when my score updates it has the same information except it says hey did you open a new loan. I would NOT recommend for that very reason they are extremely sketchy and rude and will not do what they say.,cici19986,
No-brainer.,2019-02-20 06:00:25,5,False,"Literally the best app I’ve ever downloaded. I was in a different state and found out my debit card had been hacked. I tried to call my small town bank but it was 10pm on a Saturday night so a third party answered my call. After speaking with multiple reps the only solution they could give me at the time was to shut down my debit card and go to my bank on Monday. I had no access to my funds and was literally stuck. I searched for apps and remembered an app I downloaded a month prior who had sent me a debit. I thought it would be just like NetSpend who sends you multiple cards per year randomly for signups....I was so wrong. I opened the app, activated my card, hit the loan button and crossed my fingers.

Poor Customer Service and Conditions,2019-10-19 13:42:34,1,False,"Do not bank with MoneyLion. Besides the access to loans, the bank needs serious work on customer service and conditions. It is outsourced so please do not think this is a bank that you will be able to reach out to at all times.  They close on weekends for one. Makes no sense to me how a bank isn’t accessible 24/7 when transactions are consistently being made. I had an issue where I was not able to access my funds because it takes 1-2 business days for funds to clear and be transferred to other banks. I’ve called numerous times regarding my direct deposit and the $500 loan you receive when linking a deposit. Do not do this as it is a tedious process. I understand the purpose of paying off the loan but adding on extra fees just to access it, is unclear. I joined with this bank thinking it was more flexible and direct when it came to everything it has to offer. Now I am deeply regretting my choice. Choose Chime or Varo if you want similar benefits without the hassle. Once my funds clear, im unlinking and closing my account. Never again.",ariebby1,
Overall a good financial app with great features,2019-01-26 20:04:03,5,False,"I was skeptical at first but now I am very pleased I decided to go ahead with this app and company. I have all my bank accounts linked, I am a Plus member, and even have utilized their low interest loan. Everything works nicely for the most part and I like the cash back feature for signing in on a daily basis. It forces me to check all my accounts daily and see where I am at in terms of my budget. I deducted one star because it could be improved in terms of compatibility with one of my cards (Amex Serve) and sometimes I have issues with the app glitching, but that’s not often. 

I would definitely recommend this app to someone who is concerned with their credit score, maintaining a budget, and possibly getting into some automatic investment options. I utilize every feature and am happy with it. Have been using it almost 6 months.",xenabear845,

Seems a bit Shady,2018-10-11 15:20:33,2,False,"I had a MoneyLion plus account for about 2 months. Signed on everyday and engaged in the daily trivia and read the articles but I didn’t find much success with the program. I’m sure long term I would have seen my money grow and develop more but the money I had in my MoneyLion account compared to the money I was actually putting in every 2 weeks was vastly different. I think I would have more bang for my buck using another app like acorns or stash. 

Lastly, I cancelled my account September 13th and to date still haven’t received my money. Initially, I was given 7-10 business days for a refund. On October 1st I received an email stating that it was a delay and it would be 5 more business days. Then I called today and they said there is no way to give me a timeline on when I will receive my money.

Personally, I’ve struggled with money for years. Having that perk was just another reason I knew ML was the perfect service for me. Some may say that the membership fee is high, but you have to consider a good portion of that is put right into your investment account. It’s simple and easy!

Moneylion has made sure of it. The loan payments weren’t drafting from my bank account even when I left plenty of money for them to do so.

Regarding the app, you cannot just make a payment on the loan, unless you’re paying it off. Also, be aware that they will lock you into a useless membership that you have to pay for, just for doing the loan. You will be unable to cancel the membership until the loan is paid off, which is totally illegal, due to their requirement to ACH your account for the loan and the membership fees.

On top of that, my amount available to withdraw kept saying $0.00. The minimum amount is $150. $278 is greater than $150. That figure had been there for a month.

One feature I wish they would bring back is when they would add $1 each day you would login to the app to your investment account. I found myself using MoneyLion a lot more when that was around.

Helpful app to track and save for the future.,2019-03-17 10:28:04,5,False,"There are probably only a handful of similar online only banks.  ML is great I can tract all accounts. It helps with balancing your spending with saving. It has partnerships with vendors that can help you save money in many ways. It helps educate you in how money moves and how investment work.

I know that sounds weird but that’s the vibe it gives me. This app is meant for the upper working class and higher because I can’t think of any one person who could afford the plus program and not be completely put into a bind every month! And that’s out of friends and family!
I think that if you live paycheck to paycheck this app probably would help you a lot with your finances but you would need to work overtime and double shifts just to keep up with it which is very unrealistic!

Come this month again and they still hadn’t changed it over. Only reason I didn’t incur any fees is because I caught it early and transferred funds to cover the payments. I call customer service and that’s an adventure in itself. Email is just as pointless. It’s like talking to a child, which I believe has better logic.

No customer service. Period.,2020-07-29 22:07:16,2,False,"I just learned that my tax refund will be returned to sender when the IRS tries to pay me—seemingly all because MoneyLion has ended their relationship with Lincoln Savings Bank...

Oh, and YOU now have to scramble to update any direct deposit or bill paying you already had set up, before YOU face real life consequences...but MoneyLion doesn’t care about poor people. 

This is really just an app that was designed so some rich bros could make more money off of poor people’s meager livelihoods. It’s not really a bank. You cannot call and speak to a human about anything. I’m not exaggerating. I tried for hours to find a phone number for a human being that represents MoneyLion as a company and they just don’t seem to exist—or perhaps don’t want to be contacted. You can chat with a bot though! In essence, MoneyLion deposits your money in some no-name “bank” somewhere and then play with it. That’s their service.

Worst decision I’ve made,2019-12-20 03:33:20,2,False,"Hate this company. Of all the others I have, this was the first time I actually set up direct deposit. You don’t get 500 loan really, it’s 3. You get access to 10% of  your direct deposit, so you have to direct deposit 3k just to instantly be able to utilize 300$, smh lol. Never got the card, hard to get in touch with and even when you finally get them the reps have no power or authority or unable to do anything. Again worst decision I’ve made when it comes to utilizing these online banking. I did the loan builder for $500. They literally gave me $300 and says I owe them $500 even though 200 is trapped in a reserve account until you pay off the $300. But when you hit pay off it’s saying you owe $500 lol. I can’t owe on money I can’t use or touch. Just all in all not too good, I like the shake reward stuff but overall bad business.

Never again,2019-01-14 21:27:13,1,False,"Okay, so this app talks about $500 loans, helping build credit, etc. I’ve been a member 4 months short of a year, and my credit hasn’t budged at all. With the amount the membership fee is, on top of repaying your loan, you’re essentially paying around $2,500 for ONE $500 loan. Sure, they put some of that into your “savings” and they say it’s your money, but you can’t touch it. Even once you paid off the loan, you still have to keep $150 balance in the savings. On top of that, if you change jobs and your pay periods change, they have no problem overdrafting your account with very little help. If you need to talk to customer service, you’ll wait an hour for anyone to reply, and if you happened to put your phone the ONE MINUTE they replied and you don’t answer, they’ll close the convo and you have to wait ANOTHER hour.

We'd be more than happy to clarify a few things in regards to having a MoneyLion Plus membership. We do require that each active member of MoneyLion Plus keep $150 in the investment account at all times although, if that member ever decides to cancel their membership, we do take the liberty of liquidating your investment account. Although having a MoneyLion Plus membership has the potential to assist with your credit building (since we do report on-time payments), each members credit history is different and can be effected in different forms. Although $79 is deducted out of your checking account monthly to have the membership, we take $50 of that and place it into your checking account. Then the additional $29 can be subsidized if the member logs into their account every day of the month to receive their $1 cash back (which we also place into your investment account as well). We do pride ourselves in providing world-class customer service to each of our members and we are always happy to assist with any question or concern. If any questions arise, always feel free to review our FAQ/Support page (support.moneylion.com), but of course, if you can't find the answer there, you are always welcome to contact us at 1-800-617-9584 (M-F 8 AM-8 PM EST; SAT 10:30 AM-6 PM EST)."", 'modified': '2019-01-16T15:52:40Z'}"
Good luck canceling...,2018-07-26 02:58:23,1,False,"I am so irritated with this company... and if I could give them zero stars I would. All is fine until you try to cancel.

So a week went by-account was cancelled- they said it would take 7-10 business days to cash out my investment. Ten business days go by... nothing in my account. So I email. There was a “system error” and my request wasn’t processed.

Shady Services,2020-03-14 23:47:12,1,False,"Customer service help hides as much as they can from at MoneyLion. I had the smallest of problems with some missing rewards points for financial activities.  (I feel very lucky now that It was only that.)

I emailed and submitted ticket on help MoneyLion’s help center.  It was ignored.
So I had to dig and dig to find a phone number. Why would they want it listed anywhere quick to find?
After I did find a number, they still didn’t correct the situation.  The service rep read to me what her computer stated that I have as a total for points. Verified the activities to receive points were showing on her end and that the rest of the points hadn’t been added for those activities.   But then said she couldn’t fix. 

She asked me to send a screenshot of my points balance. (Makes no sense, because our information is exactly the same)
I told her “my total is the same as your total, If your screen shows the inaccuracy, and you just told me what is missing.. why do you need anything else to resolve this issue?”

Then she said it’s because she can’t. I asked her, “well who can?”  She said I’d have to submit another ticket online thru the help center.  I asked for a supervisor, no one available.  So then I asked for a supervisor to call me back since ‘none were available’ at the moment.  It’s been a week and a half. No one was called me back or fixed the issue.

When you finally get someone on the phone for help, all they do is argue with you instead of trying to help you. If you send an email to their support email, it takes about a week for a response even though their email says one business day. Be careful on how they handle your investment profile. If you compare your investment portfolio in the app to your statements through drive wealth you will see they mislead you on how they are handling your investment funds. The only thing keeping me from closing my account is I have two months left before I pay off my loan. After that Im closing my account.

Eh I hope my theory is wrong here,2019-01-26 23:10:47,3,False,"But I think I understand now why this app has such high rating and yet I’ve never heard of it. During my career in the banking industry I’ve come across many financial institutions so I’m a bit of a skeptic at this point. To me, it seems like the high ratings could be attributed to a high volume of users who think there is an incentive to give a good review. Primarily because they ask you to rate their app immediately upon opening it for the very first time. I don’t care who you are, you CANNOT knowledgeably rate anything in this world without using said service prior to rating it!!! That alone should tell you that the ratings a skewed which can consequently show you business ethics of the company who’s providing the service. Food for thought... I very well could be wrong about them. Only way to know is for me to first use the app!!!

Sounds great but nothing works,2019-06-08 15:08:28,1,False,"Where to start... I personally have experienced the following due to “technical issues”: direct deposit not posting to account, during a transaction check to prevent fraud, moneylion provided an old phone number (because when you change it in app, it only changes it in your personal profile not in their banking system) so my card was locked and I was unable to access my funds, customer service frequently provides incorrect information, now there’s no customer service number - you submit a ticket via a ticket system. It’s supposed to be faster... it’s not! I have never received a response in less than 3 days (including for my card being locked). They unlinked my external account (but you also can’t add a new one) so I also could not transfer money in or out. That ticket had still not been responded to and we are at 8 days. Today I got an email for another ticket that’s been open for 5 days saying they are no longer responding to tickets by email - you have to fill out another form and request a call back. 

There have been so many other issues- you are not eligible for plus if you switch your direct deposit to your moneylion account which they don’t tell you. 
All in all, Even an apology any time I’ve communicated with them would be nice but they don’t do anything for you. I would never recommend this account to anyone!

Good luck to you all. I hope your experience is different.",number1priority,"{'id': 9710325, 'body': ""Hi there, thanks for reaching out.

I am so unhappy with this app for those who are enjoying it I envy you because I was excited about using this app and for it to do this.

It Takes DAYS to Contact Them.

In other words, money, payments, financial stuff —that’s what they do, that’s their ‘thing so that it took me two days to Make a simple, single, routine payment defies all logic. I should probably note that when I say it took two days, it didn’t take two days to actually resolve my issue. It literally took two days before I could even access a human being. For me, it became clear that while the program is novel and intriguing it is, similarly, a sprawling, if not byzantine collection of services dad is in serious restructuring that presents their array of options in a more thoughtful, intuitive, efficient manner that prioritizes USABILITY and reflects some serious thought around how and why their customers use their site.",MarqKrysto,

I tried emailing them because I got an email that I didn’t make a payment, then the payment magically appears. Also, I’ve tried to change my phone number and I had to fill out a address change form for a PHONE number. It take DAYS for someone to respond to your email for a simple phone change. Also apparently your investments take 5-7 days to be transferred. I paid off my loan early to wait what’s now been 3 days to change my phone number and now another week basically to get my money back.

Then he tells me I don’t have enough it has to be at least $1000 a month. I have over $3700 a month deposited into my account by the VA every month. He finally finds this and then says it’s because it’s not showing up as a Direct Depisit but as a transfer lol. Give me a break. It shows up as a Direct Deposit from the Federal Reserve!

( kind of scary when u need money and why I now have a minimal portion of my paycheck deposited to the account).

Some other screens do basically the same kind of glitches, they just never seem to go to whatever the next screen is supposed to be or you have to enter information twice.  I like the GUI, it would be intuitive if it worked properly.

Very shady company,2018-08-29 03:12:22,1,False,"I signed up for a MoneyLion Plus account thinking it would be a great way to force myself to save money. Immediately after signing up and providing my correct pay dates, I can see on my dashboard that my “membership fees” were scheduled to be taken out of my bank account several days before the pay date I specified. 

I had to wait 15 minutes to get someone to chat with me and they told me it was a “technical error” and that I would have to provide several pay stubs and a letter from my employer to verify my pay dates when I provided them correctly in the first place. So shady. There is absolutely no way I made a mistake in entering the dates, I checked them before I continued.

I am sad about this because I thought this app would be a great opportunity for me. I can’t trust a company that will make ACH debits from my account in any day they decide. 

I asked to please cancel my account and was told I’d have to wait 48 hours and that they couldn’t guarantee whether or not my first membership payment would be denoted from my account. The first scheduled day for payment is over 2 weeks away, not sure why there would even be a chance of them taking my money if my account is supposed to be deleted in 2 days.

Currently I’ve been waiting on hold for 40 minutes to cancel my account, how is that standard business protocol? This was after I had to search the Internet for their phone number as you  won’t find the number anywhere on the app, I don’t know about you but I do not trust my money with people I can’t even get ahold of. App is glitchy and when you finally get ahold of someone they are not helpful in the slightest and will even refer you back to the FAQ page which has no helpful info, just plain lazy. Not the staff’s fault by any means but this “bank” is trash. They advertise “no fees” however you’ll end up paying wayyyy to much for their plus plan that allows you to do all the things they advertise.

"Difficult to work with, not straightforward, will lose money",2019-07-05 18:39:34,1,False,"I originally opened this to get the credit builder loan. The membership fee scheme was a little confusing but basically as long as you logged in everyday you’d get your monthly fee back into an investment account. On top of that you would earn points and be able to redeem those points easily through the app for gift cards.

Now they’ve changed it so that you have to use their checking account to get the fee back and also have a checking account to redeem points. The problem is that to activate the card I ordered I’d have to fill out paperwork to change a phone number to activate the debit card. I’d rather use bank accounts that are more straightforward and easy to do maintenance on.

Bottom line is this is not a straightforward company, everything is very hard to get done and usually involves emailing paperwork, and you’ll end up losing more money than if you just didn’t bother in the first place.",drewhunt21,"{'id': 9690574, 'body': ""Hi drewhunt21, sorry to hear you're having difficulties.

It is legitimate.,2019-09-28 05:03:21,5,True,"This app does what it says. I got my loan the same day I applied. I have been paying it off on time and my credit score has gone up. The credit score was just a bonus really, I needed the extra money ASAP at the time. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs some quick cash in a pinch. The only downside is you are required to get the “membership” which combined with paying back the loan adds up to $30/week for one year. 🙄 So be mindful of that. You do get all the cool features being a member provides & you can pay off the loan sooner — but it has to be all at once, you can’t just make a bigger payment. Long story short, it’s legit.

Total Scam,2019-08-08 16:05:16,1,False,"It’s easy to get approved for a $500 loan, but hard to pay it off. 

While you owe them money, they will be withdrawing around $50 every paycheck, but only $20 will go towards paying your loan. They rest goes towards your membership fees and a BS investment account they set up for you. 

The investment account is another trap. You can’t take out money while you owe them money. It eventually gets to the point where you have enough “invested” to pay off your loan, but they don’t let you do that, of course. 

When you finally pay your loan off, the investment account is way for them to keep their teeth sunk into you. You just can’t withdraw your money, you have to wait for them to liquidate and send you your money. But wait, that’s when a convenient error pops up, and you’re left waiting WEEKS to get your money. 

Don’t bother reaching out to customer service, though. They’ll just answer by copying and pasting their FAQs, which don’t answer your question. If you do get someone to answer you, they’ll just give you the run around and close your ticket so you can’t contact them again. 

Dealing with this app has been a nightmare for a year. It’s a scam, and a trap, those $500 sound real good if you’re real desperate but be careful, you’re getting more than you bargained for.

It could to a point where I couldn’t continue to pay for the membership and they suspended my account so the money I had left in my account I wasn’t able to use and when I asked why they said the only was I could have access to my money is by restarting the membership but when I went to check my account they used the money I had to put towards my loan after saying that I could set up my own payments so now I’m out of my money that was held in account that’s I wasn’t allowed to use because I couldn’t afford to pay for the membership.,azjrsc,"{'id': 13972956, 'body': ""Hi there!

Bad decision using money lion,2019-08-08 20:40:19,1,False,When I started moneylion I was interested in the 5.99% loan that helps build my credit. They charged $29 at the money for the Plus membership which you could get it all back by logging in daily. It also required you invest $50 a month. Fast forward a few months they force a change and don’t require an investment account anymore. They also change the fee to $20/m but no way to get it waived or earned it back anymore. So realistically the loan cost 5.99% + $20/month. $500 loan pays back almost $800+. Not worth it. I’ve tried to cash out my investment account for weeks and can’t. I’ve called and emailed at least 20 times and NO responses. I want to pay this crap off and get my money out. Your support is literally impossible to get in touch with. I’ve called and wait 30 minutes until it says they will call back as soon as an agent is available but never get a response. Can’t wait to close this stupid account I’m so annoyed.,Rtellez,
"I wish they would take the fees away, but it’s helped.",2020-12-03 16:31:54,5,False,"I have had this app going on a couple months now. It has helped us out of bad spots. However, it’s like a horrible circle of constant need of it because of the 5$ you have to pay all the time to get it when you actually need it. It tends to add up very quickly. I’ve heard bad stories about different loans but I have always used the instacash and it is amazing! Other than the 5$ fee to get it fast.

When getting it fast though it truly helps when bills become to much and we need food. When I do ask for instacash I usually get it within that minute of clicking instant for $5.

On another note, if I need a deferment for a loan I had taken out they have been very gracious to help me. Even right now, all I have to do is email them. Because sometimes it glitches and it says you can only do it once a month. But I haven’t gotten one this month and we truly need the extra time. But we will see how this goes.

"A great value then, not so much now.",2019-08-02 06:41:25,1,True,"Been a Plus customer for over a year. 6 months ago, I write this and it’s probably 5 stars. But as many have said, MoneyLion seems hellbent on terrible customer service and,
even worst, not so into decent financial services for an underserved demographic anymore.

I’ve been trying to pay my loan off early for the last two months. I’ve had nothing but problems using my debit card or checking to pay off through the app or desktop. Multiple tickets. Multiple attempts. Nothing.

Customer service is non-existent, either you go through the app, their online helpdesk, or hold forever on the phone. You’ll wait forever and maybe hear back. Your issue won’t be resolved. 

Plus was changed with very little information given. We pay less (good) per pay period but no automatic withdrawal and your Lions Share rewards (which used to be cashback deposited into your investment account) seem to be tied to their MoneyLion checking account now.

You have to link your card or bank account in about 5 different places within the app; they don’t seem to be connected at all.

There is still no one assisting my issues, so they are going to start collecting payment on a loan I never received.     I’m being robbed and there is no sign of customer service anywhere.

That’s when he tried to explain that I can not transfer out of my investment until I pay the ENTIRE loan balance. That was not stated clearly.

Nice at first,2019-02-09 16:54:22,3,False,"I initially downloaded this app as an effort to force myself to save money and at first it was actually quite nice. I was approved for a loan and eventually was able to earn enough points for a gift card which I got the same day I redeemed it. After that I began noticing that I wasn’t receiving points for making on time payments, the app glitches occasionally and you don’t always get your $1 for scrolling through it, making you start your streak all over (losing more points for rewards). Life happened and I decided to with draw from my savings, over $400, but could only get $60. The with draw fee that is stated to be only 25 cents somehow turned into $3.

Worst customer service of my life !,2019-10-26 00:05:55,1,False,"Just horrible! Never in my life have i ever dealt with worse customer service. Great app but just disgusting that you cant keep up with the customer service. First of all there is an alert out on this company with the BBB for their customer service, and has been for a while and they’ve made no visible effort to improve it . They don’t care at all. They will NEVER answer a phone call. And will maybe reply to a support request or email in a week or so but you will not receive any help and most of the time they just tell you to call them. They close your support requests without helping you. This is the most irritating thing to write about because they will comment on this review to call them! But they NEVER EVER will answer, then they say they'll call you back. You might get a call back from a “scam” or foreign number and 9/10 times they hang up. Unbelievable.

Is now a fraud,2019-09-12 21:38:40,1,False,I wrote a review earlier but I don’t see it. Maybe they couldn’t handle the truth. I paid this loan off on September 5th 2019 with a debit card which was removed from my account within minutes. They still tried to withdraw a payment from my checking account which I informed my banking institution not to allow MoneyLion to withdraw any payment. Well next week I received notification that they then tried to withdraw the amount I paid off. What!!! I keep going on the site to see what they have on my account which says trying to process payment what do you mean the payment that was debited from my account the same day then it stated payment will be processed by the 9th this is now the 12th. Customer service is a joke stayed on hold only to be disconnected. Did this several days. With all the negative reviews this company needs to be reported to better business bureau. I now can’t receive my investment now. Can you say scammers!!!,feeling f*****,
Worst ripoff online,2018-10-25 01:28:50,1,False,The app is set up to give you weekly payments and a loan with weekly payments.  The app has set up where you can link new accounts. Unfortunately this goes through an entire process of linking accounts but does not link them so if your bank account is corrupted it does not update with new bank info and the app continues to try and draw off old account information bouncing accounts and accruing fees from money lion. They said the only way to update bank I for nation was to call them directly. The website does not have a phone number listed to contact them. So when you finally email and they return your email 5 days later the auto pay try’s  to  make another withdrawal. When I questioned money lion on the app they could not answer why the app allows you to update bank info but not withdraw from the new info only way to do it is to call. Fyi they will not refund fees associated with the app not properly working.,ndowbfoad r,"{'id': 6794134, 'body': 'Hey there ndowbfoad r! We appreciate you taking to time to let us know your feedback.

More of a headache,2018-09-22 14:48:07,2,False,"I’ll give it to this app - when you need an extra 500 or however much they give you, they can give you it. And customer service is very good. But as for the bad.
First you can’t withdraw money from the investment account if you have a current loan, something that wasn’t made clear to me upfront so here I was depositing cash into the account not realizing I wouldn’t be able to withdraw until I paid everything off. Then once you pay it fully off, they make you leave $150 in the account as long as you have a plus account. So you have to go through the process of liquidating the investment account to get that $150, a process that’s taking me going on a month just to get the cash.
Dunno, just in general there was a lot of headaches with this app and constantly felt like someone was f*#%ng with my money. Learned a lesson here, never borrow money unless you absolutely need to.

False Advertising - Poor Service,2018-07-02 01:17:43,1,False,"I tried connecting two bank accounts to unlock MoneyLion Plus, neither worked.  I reached out for help and the first time I was told it was an issue with my bank, I called my bank and they verified that the issue was with the app.  I reached back out to there customer service (it took 20 mins for a live person to pop on the line) where they then said they do not support my bank. So I tried my second account, I was confident that it would work since they had a giant logo of my bank to click on to login. So I entered my info and then got a “hold on this may take a few mins to set up” message, hours later nothing. So I message the customer support people, 1 hour later they respond that they don’t support the state I live in.

They won’t give me my $700 back!,2020-01-15 17:56:28,1,False,"Really frustrated with this app. First off the customer service is TERRIBLE! They are very hard to understand and they are useless because they consistently keep pointing you back to the help forms. 

The problem I’m experiencing right now is that I have $700 in the moneylion checking account and I am trying to transfer it to a chase account I use.  After several attempts of linking and unlinking my account it keeps giving me an error that says they can not verify my account. Which I think is stupid because they were able to link that same account to take money out of it!  Taking money is easy but when you try to take it out it’s a problem. Customer support over the phone confirmed I would be receiving the money to my external checking account and after several days nothing happened. 

I then tried to email them. My first email was responded to and then after several attempts to email them back I have not heard from them. I called customer support again today and after 45 minutes of going around in circles they told my that I have to submit a form on their help center website to go to their internal department.  

I have spoken to two customer service reps and sent a several emails and help forms and have yet to resolve this issue.

What the heck is that ? Makes no sense so you guys really are ripping us off by making almost quadruple off of me . On a $500 loan you will end up making around $1,500-$2,000 because of that $36 fee . I have to pay almost 125 a month on a $500 loan for a year ?

Two payments for the membership come out of my bank account each month but this is still your money. You’re building on it. Of course it might not be for everyone depending on your financial situation. I’m working to budget better and secure myself financially and this app is essentially helping me do that. I was approved for the $500 loan which I use to pay off a different credit card. Their loan is interest free and didn’t hurt my credit, then I pay them back $21 a month for that loan.

Customer Service needs improvement,2019-10-04 16:28:01,3,False,"I downloaded the app and, overall, it’s fairly user friendly. However, if you ever need to speak to anyone in customer service, you probably won’t ever be able to. They never answer, tell you that all reps are busy, and they’ll call you back. They NEVER call back that day, regardless when you placed the call, but instead seem to always call when I cannot answer my phone because I am at work a few days later, then leaving a message to call a “direct “ line. It’s not direct in any way and you start the frustrating process all over again. The app itself could be improved as well.

This bank is so frustrating,2019-04-11 21:31:37,1,False,"I’ve had issues from the start with direct deposit. Instacash won’t work without direct deposit and sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. I’m prompted to setup direct deposit when it doesn’t work. I have deposited weekly for several months.

This would be a simple solution if customer service were able to help which leads me to my second issue. You better have at least an hour or two to wait on hold or stare at the chat box. There’s no option for callback, and if you close the app you won’t see when support messages you on the chat. Long story short, if you are a busy person, you are better off finding a bank that has a reasonable wait time or a callback option.

You cannot currently use the Moneylion Checking account (the one they want you to setup direct deposit for) to pay for Moneylion Plus. You can’t use their banking service to pay for a loan/investment service within the SAME COMPANY. Not very intuitive. I need two checking accounts to make this work and I shouldn’t have to.

All these issues and they continue to try and roll out new features, when they need to focus on fixing the features they have.

Another review going nowhere. DO NOT do business with this awful company,2020-05-20 14:36:42,1,False,"I have explained this situation to countless customer representatives at Money Lion. Some of the names include: Aron R., Alvin Villasana, Levy D, Jane (who left the chat when I showed her proof that the loan was paid off), etc. I have been dealing with this since February and have filed a complaint with BBB after dealing with the runaround and false information provided. 

Every single time, I speak to a customer representative, they admittedly state it’s a “technical error” and they will be getting this to either 1. Their engineers or 2. Specialized team but it never gets resolved. My loan is still showing outstanding when I have already paid it off. You impacted my credit (while I’m in the process of getting a mortgage) by inaccurately reporting me late when I never missed a payment. I need the app updated not in 30 days, not next week, but now. I have called them to get it escalated countless times, only to be put on hold or hung up on. I do already see a lawsuit was filed against your company in Virginia and another one in California for excessive fees. Please do not fall for the CreditBullder Plus loan like I did.

Some don’t seem to like it because can’t borrow too much at first. But once you’ve borrowed and payed back a few times, the amount you can borrow is increased. 

I say this is one of the best lending apps because you can request to borrow more money even if you still have one your paying off (if you qualify).

Bad online site,2020-02-23 14:12:44,2,True,"There online website stays with glitches . I have tried to update my money investment account numerous times , even thru email . And over and over it’s the same response . They have my old bank info . And every time I try to update my new bank info it will not show . This is for my money lion investment account only . Not the payment method . The withdrawal. I think after this I will no longer get this . I will only keep it to help my credit score . Also the payment interest are too high .

"Good app, overall",2019-04-29 17:19:56,4,False,"Honestly it saved me a lot of money, but the one catch is ya gotta be careful cause that money in your investment account can’t be withdrawn UNLESS you pay off your $500 loan.

So, it’s a win but then ya kinda have your money stuck until you pay up the $500 really I don’t think they will ever let me withdrawal my investment funds until I pay off the $500 loan which could be all the way next year a full year from now so virtually those investment funds are irrelevant... nonexistent...",19192slab,

So I called them today(8/19) to check on the progress. After waiting on hold for an hour, I was told that the liquidation process had just started and I’d have to wait another 7-10 business days to get my money.

Nope bank says it’s all good it’s on the apps side .

 10/24 it still has not posted so I used $50 transferred from my investment account to repay it

Here it is 10/30 and that $50 from my attached bank has still not shown!! Where is my money?

This app came around when I was struggling and couldn’t figure out how to pay the power bill , rent and fees my kids. I searched online for any kind of payday loan. I knew I would never be able to afford the payments. Then I found Moneylion. I felt there was no way this company would loan me anything. To my surprise not only did they loan me $500 but it was in my bank the next morning. I was able to pay my power bill and everything else!  Moneylion has saved me numerous times since.

So many problems with tech support / app,2018-11-30 21:21:41,1,False,"At first I liked the app for so many reasons. One day the app logged me out automatically I suppose, for some reason, so I had to log back in.  

Apparently When doing so, the app allowed me to set up a duplicate account and maybe I had another one I had set up on the dashboard. 

so I had to call 2-3 times this week to get someone to merge them. I couldn’t even log back in because tech support forgot to tell me they capitalized the first letter in my email address for my user name. They said to call back 24 hours later and I finally figured out what they did and was able to log in, no thanks to them.  

Now when I login to the app on my phone, I can’t see my Plus benefits and the app keeps prompting me to activate their debit card but according to tech support, “everything looks fine” on their end. 

I finally sent them screen shots over email and have yet to hear back why the app is not correct on my phone (yes I deleted it and re-downloaded it, yes I logged out and logged back in).

Maybe in a few weeks or months the app will be fixed; I give up.

If the person who answered doesn’t know what to do, you’ll be placed on hold for an additional 20 minutes to be transferred to another department who will have no idea who you are, will ask all your info all over again and you will have to repeat yourself again. 

The FAQ’s are essentially useless. If you email support about a particular issue, they will take 2-3 days to respond and will tell you to just call customer service. The chat option is decent whenever it works. 

I want to like this app, but if you have an emergency, you won’t count on these people helping you right away.",Mrbowser89,
Unsure...,2019-04-01 17:35:07,3,True,So all in all it is not a bad app. However there are a couple of smaller things that bring my overall satisfaction down. It often times doesn’t register my direct deposit. I receive my money but for the purpose of taking out an instacash advance it’s not there. Luckily I haven’t had a need for the instacash option but if I had a need I couldn’t get one since it doesn’t recognize my direct deposit. Which brings me to my next issue. The text to chat option is never available and they are always “experiencing higher than normal call volume” so talking with anyone is almost non existent. The loan builder is fine and I lose no money on the monthly fee since I log in daily. But these little things make me wonder what’s going on behind the scenes.,Johnny Ray K,"{'id': 6794112, 'body': 'Hey there Johnny Ray K! We appreciate you taking to time to let us know your feedback.

New perspective on loans and investments,2019-02-07 23:54:34,5,False,When I first downloaded MoneyLion I was hesitant on taking out the loan because I thought it was a scam. I tried looking for bad reviews but couldn’t find any. Not too long after I applied the loan was authorized and sent right to my account just like they said. I couldn’t understand how it could be so easy. Especially after trying at other places and could only get a payday loan. Not only did I get the money quickly but as I paid it back Money Lion helped me to raise my credit score. The investment account is a plus!! Now I have a 0% APR Checking account. Another awesome product. Awesome company!! Can’t give enough accolades!,dbhMEdia,

Great app for passive investing,2019-03-15 00:53:20,5,False,"This is actually a pretty good app for a really passive investor. You don’t get to pick and choose the specific investment but they have preset strategies that perform fine (currently on most aggressive). Compared to other apps like Stash and Acorns, their passive strategies beat Stash and Acorns once you factor in there’s no fee vs stash/acorns’ dollar a month (it really eats into gains if you don’t have a huge portfolio). On top of that the loan + gift cards are sweet. I’m almost on my 3rd gift card in less than a year. That’s $75 in rewards.

Lifesaver! App just has a minor bug.,2019-03-13 19:30:26,4,False,"I originally only downloaded this app for their loan offer because they don’t check your credit score, though in order to do so you do have to sign up for a checking account. No biggie because their checking account has a good set of perks.

The loan payments are easy with low APR. a percentage goes into an investment account too, so even when you’re paying for your past you’re building a future. Personally, I really like that.

You even get to add to your investment for free every day by just logging in and scrolling through some quick financial tips.

Easy but membership fee is ridiculous,2018-05-25 13:32:17,3,False,"It was easy to get the money and didn’t have to jump through hopes to get the loan but I’m not happy with the membership fee that I have to pay. $36 every two weeks on top of the loan payment. Yes it lets you know before hand about it, I was in a desperate situation but now that I was able to resolve my situation it seems ridiculous to pay a membership fee of that amount when I’m only paying $19 towards the actual loan. And no there is no way around the membership it is required. You are better off getting it and then paying it all at once so you don’t essentially pay double the loan because of the membership fee.

Not bad,2019-05-02 21:04:51,4,False,"Signed up a couple months ago, had to wait 30 days to unlock my loan and just recently got it. It’s pretty straight forward. You link your bank account and they setup your payments to match your payday. Log in to the app everyday and your membership is basically free. I look at the investment account as kind of like a savings account and On top of that, you build credit with the loan. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal... unless you’re irresponsible with your money and miss your payments and then want to blame it on the lender, like a lot of the bad reviewers here lol. If you can’t pay it back, don’t take the money. Lost a star for subpar customer service though (still tolerable).",CEO_mbm,

Even a little note, you know, may not be available in all states? Very frustrating. So now I wait until it either is available or I move to a state where it is.",so blessed sierra,

I check the account everyday until it gets for eh $1 back reward but it still manages to say I missed days. Before I thought maybe I did or maybe I didn’t scroll through properly but I know it’s just erasing data or something I specifically made sure to check twice a day and it still said I missed two days when I know I checked. That so far is the only issue I have with the app everything else seems to be running fine I just tried the loan and it was available the next day in my account so we will see how the interest works out,ChazmineCharisse,

Enjoying my experience so far,2019-06-03 17:39:28,4,False,"I want to say this company has had more trouble out of me than I have had with them. Easy loans, I love the investment option of my monthly payment ultimately being saved for me. I’ve gotten gift cards for being a member—great tips on how to get back any bank fees through companies they’ve referred. I really enjoy being a member. The only reason why they do not have 5 stars is because it took me A MONTH to pay off my loan early because their website and app does not do half the things it’s suppose to do. Overall, I recommend to at least inquire. It will give you money, take your money, and save your money.",SuYaSamHarris,

After 4hours of going back and forth with different documents it still wasn’t enough now they have my drivers license my cell phone bill, my utilitybills etc I gave up. Not sure if it’s a scam but I asked that they destroy all documents I sent then they sent a form for that and said it takes 45days to receive word.

Needs To Add Another Feature To Make It More Enjoyable For Its Customers,2020-12-13 12:15:16,4,False,"The app is great & all, but I personally think that it needs to add another feature which is taking a picture of a check whenever we want to deposit it. Other known banks have added that feature on their own apps but MoneyLion apparently has not. I would love to have that feature on this app because it would be easier to deposit any checks that we receive from anyone else.

READ FINE PRINT,2018-06-08 17:12:23,1,False,They advertise that they will give you $1 a day as long as you swipe thru the cards and that you’re memebership could be $0 monthly. Sounds good right ? Well they still take the $29 monthly fee from you and the $1 they give you gets added into an investment account which you can’t withdraw from until you have $150 in and then at that point they’ll tel you that you cannot withdraw you’re account under a balance of $150. So it would take you 6 months of paying $80 monthly just to withdraw $150. This app might build you’re credit but it is just as expensive as a phone bill. Once you take out a loan your in a bind for $80 monthly for a year or until your loan is payed off. Good app for someone who has no other expensive and has $80 a month extra to not be used.

Where’s customer service!?,2020-02-14 04:08:23,1,False,I am having so much trouble with repaying back my instacash. So It only lets you make 4 attempts with a debit card to repay back what you borrowed and after the 4 attempts it does not let you pay back with your debit card. Then after the 4 attempts it says in order to pay back instacash you need a money lion checking account. So tried to make a money lion checking account and it said having trouble please try again in one week. Came back in one week did the same thing l. But I am also paying the monthly fee witch is $9.99 so I tried to cancel my subscription and it does not let me unless I pay my instacash back .

No customer support at all,2020-01-25 16:04:44,1,False,"I called and emailed for weeks regarding needing to change my bank information. All I was told, was that it was a process on the app, which I was fully aware of but IT DIDNT WORK. I explained that my membership and loan payment would NOT work if they kept using my old account. MONEYLION still tried and overdrew my account over $200 and that’s more than I owed on the loan. 
I called for help and was given directions by TWO “supervisors” and I followed them and nobody replied. I’ve emailed and I get generic replies, nothing helpful. I get no calls back. I had to file a credit fraud and dispute claim because I TRIED to pay, it was documented, and MoneyLion just blows me off.

Overdraft & nsf fee overload,2020-01-05 19:40:33,1,False,"All financial institutions that operate through the clearinghouse can request an available funds inquiry prior to scheduled draft payments of whatever loan or monthly membership fee ( which is outrageously high ). If there are not funds available, then they should stop any request for payment to prevent hurting your financial situation instead of make you worse off. Instead money lion will pull the draft payment, make you go negative with your bank, also make your status delinquent and report you negatively to the credit bureaus.

Each month I was depositing $50 not a lot but it’s a start.

Pros and cons,2019-02-13 11:28:27,5,False,"So far so great. It’s a great way for saving money while feeling like you’re not. I love the fact that you get $1.00 back every day for interacting with the app daily, makes the membership practically free! And even if you do forget a few days you won’t be paying full price for the membership. Basically them telling you to be financially alert every day or we’ll charge you full price for the membership. The only con about the app and membership is that you HAVE to deposit a fixed amount and you can’t change it. Other than that the app is pretty superb.",Truyqo,
Great app,2018-07-22 13:11:59,5,False,"It’s a great app so far but has a lot of hidden agendas. The app really does cost you money but it’s good because it forces you to save. It’s $79 with $50 allocated to savings, $20 that you get back if you open the app everyday and scroll through your cards with tips to help you manage your finances, and $9 to the app. This isn’t really bad because it forces you to save the money instead of you putting it in yourself, it comes right out of your check. You can set it up bi-weekly, weekly, or once a month. Overall a pretty good app, but I don’t like how they deceive you with the advertising.",stacks$$$,
You’re not really saving,2018-11-05 16:02:08,1,False,Yeah getting the money is pretty easy and quick. Paying it off is a nightmare though. Twice now i paid off a loan in full only to wait over two weeks for it to process. They will take your payment out of your account within an hour but you won’t be able to get a new loan for who knows how long until they decide they want to process it. Also the investment account is a joke. Yeah your account says you got 400 bucks in it but if you withdraw it after paying your loan you only get like 200 bucks from it because of all the fees. The whole “view the cards each day for a dollar deal” isn’t really a deal. It’s just  ploy to make you think your saving money.

"Avoid-Trap: Awful Site, Poor App, Dysfunctional Product",2021-03-06 23:17:10,1,False,"The service sounds good, until you realize the website is years later still half baked. Contradicting itself, the app is worse. The website doesn’t actually let you make any changes, and points to the app, but the app doesn’t work for those functions because it has so many bugs.

Unless you want your credit history ruined, avoid these guys. I continued to show payments were made and apparently there was some other area that had to be paid, but that wasn’t available to see due to limitations of the app and website at the time. So instead of reaching out, ML just reports it as non payment to my credit report-even though payments were made.

I had to dispute remarks and won in my favor for some, as they continued to fail in the department of account management. Really awful when payments are ignored and they mark as unpaid.

If you enjoy wasting time, adding frustration to your life, this is the service for you. Concept is great. Execution is a failure.

DONT DO IT,2020-04-29 14:19:59,1,False,"I originally downloaded the app to get a small loan. I applied for $500 but was only able to immediately use $125 and the other $375 was held by Moneylion in an Escrow account. 
After making 3 payments, I wanted to close the account assuming I satisfied the $125 and the money being held could just go right back to Moneylion. BUT NO. They wanted me to also payoff the $375 which I never received, claiming they would give it back to me after I paid it. 

Long story short, the $500 loan is set up similar to a CD that you would get at a traditional bank. Had I been told that (yes I should ave done research), I would have made a more educated devision. My only complaint is that they gave me part of the money upfront vs the entire $500, making the process very confusing.

To provide better information, you have two options for accessing the money in your Reserve Account, as long as your Credit Builder Plus membership fees are up to date. First, you can make your regularly scheduled payments on the full $500 until the $500 loan is paid off. As soon as it’s paid off, the funds from your Credit Reserve Account will be sent to your checking account for you to enjoy. Alternatively, you can use your Credit Reserve Account money to help pay off your $500 loan in full at any time.

I feel good about the app again,2019-03-08 00:22:22,5,False,I’ve had MoneyLion for over 6 months now and I’m in love 😍 No other bank has done what MoneyLion is doing! My investment is now at 224 with the $1 a day growth! I received the MoneyLion loan to help build my credit and 💯 happy already went up 10 points! Once I pay the loan off going to keep getting it keep that credit building! I also just cashed out my 25 dollar gift card that I earned points with and bought 3 pizzas from dominos for my friends and I 👏 You’re awesome MoneyLion! I will keep referring family and friends!,Ohsowildchild,
Bugs and lack of communication,2019-08-16 03:34:50,1,False,The app is super buggy. Rewards have been down for weeks on end. I’ve contacted support and they responded with an auto generated response. After that...crickets...and still no fixes to the rewards. I’ve had my account with them for like a year and a half and the past few months have sucked. The changes to the Plus membership are completely negative. I wouldn’t recommend this account other than if you’re approved for one of the $500 loans. They actually do report it to the credit bureaus and it’s a slight boost to your score. Other than that there are plenty of other apps that do a better job of what this app touts itself as doing. I’d give it a better review if they worked on communication and fixed the bugs.,Darth Obi Wan,

          I don’t want this review to sound like I’m bashing money lion because I’ve had the app for a year and a half and it’s great... up until you have any issues. It did raise my credit score with the loan and it’s been good but now I’m paying off my loan and they don’t like the card I’m using so I’m having to go through a ridiculous process of sending documentation to change my address. 

Their email customer service is very poor with bad spelling and they sent me a reply about something completely unrelated to what I was talking about- and they make you feel like it’s your fault for having to change your address. 

Their phone customer service is also poor and their response time is insanely slow. I’ve had to call six times to try and fix my issue. Still not resolved. It’s been six weeks.

(Correct answer is my mothers name) What state was your SSN administered in, what city is the road you grew up in, what county is your hometown in, so I answer all of them correctly and it makes me repeat the questionnaire and then tells me that I am not who I am, and that I can’t apply again until next Tuesday.

The man updated her account with the correct birthday which is all we needed. But when she logged back in to her account the number, the address and the name on the account changed to my information for no reason at all? She called customer service again and was told they can’t do anything and we should just delete the app because there’s no way to fix THEIR screw up.

You Gotta’ Be Yourself,2019-03-15 09:34:08,5,False,"This app is an awesome credit builder. My only disappointments are 1.) If you are not allowed to take out more than one personal loan why am I credited for an on time payment for my current loan and still have an outstanding loan debt with them. 2.) I got a personal loan for clothing and apparel so as to attempt to stand out from the currently unflattering wave of today’s culture, I only failed because I couldn’t utilize all the funds I properly calculated do to purchases I didn’t make.

I’ve been trying to get ahold of them for 4 months now regarding $1000 deposit they never released into my account but it was confirmed to have sent successfully from the other bank. VERY BAD SERVICE! They won’t take your loan payments out of the account and it will affect your credit score. They will only take money from a linked external account.

I would stick to one of the big name banks.

Update: after writing this review, the developer sent me a message to apologize. But there are no instructions about how to fix the problem, and so my original review stands, and nothing has changed.

My credit wasn’t the best so I didn’t expect positive results but I was in need so I completed the sign up process. After linking my bank account and verifying my income I was approved for two products that allowed me to borrow what I needed until payday. Simple process and I had money in minutes.

It’s improving,2019-05-28 17:37:15,5,False,I am happy with MoneyLion again. It seems as though they weathered the storm and now are beginning to offer the services they promised. As for app development I think if you guys added ways to save money like rounding up the change to the nearest dollar things like that and then that money just automatically gets invested into your MoneyLion investment account. If you added that in the chat on the app worked I would never use another bank. You’d have me for life and probably lots of other people as well,kyleydoya,

Furthermore, I don't see the use in having a chat feature in the help section when the mobile sorry team is *never* available to chat.

The day after I created my account and signed up for one of their programs, I became quickly inundated with spam. One email after the next after the next after the next.

$29 membership fee- which offsets when you daily sign in. No brainer free money. 
$50 investment fee- come on 50 a month to invest into your future very helpful. They play it safe with who they invest in and you have the ability to change your portfolio to be more aggressive or passive on stocks and bonds 
$9.91 loan- for less then $10 a week your paying back the money showing the credit Bureau responsibility hence (secured loan)

Pretty looking marketing scam,2019-12-22 03:02:44,2,False,"The app is gorgeous I’ll give them that but you look at the fine print and find that they’re selling your info to third parties and the app also doesn’t deliver on its promises. It’s basically just a series of advertisements in an app. The “instant cash” is only if you do direct deposit through them. There’s a $10 monthly fee so their claim of “0% APR” is complete BS. I feel like this app is being marketed to people that just don’t know any better.

I was interested in the supposed rewards and cash back but that seems to be hidden somewhere and is unclear. I find these people untrustworthy and involved in false advertising and if they start spamming me I’ll be filing complaints.",mrAssman,

I log in faithfully everyday it’s part of my morning routine and most of the time it doesn’t log my log in .  Out of the blue it will come up saying keep up your 3 day streak when actually I’ve logged in everyday since I’ve started with MoneyLion.  And also the trivia game works sometimes and other times I’ll submit my answer and the time is up but it takes me back as if I just opened the trivia question and it keeps doing that over and over again.

Zero apr loans,2020-09-11 11:31:58,1,False,"Look it’s a scam so that’s why I took the 200 advance and switched Bank accounts now they really helped me with the money I need for once. they lie and say it’s zero apr but that’s cuz the loan never makes it to a year in length but the interest rate is 5% for every 50 dollar loan . They only do it in 50 dollar increments aswell. So maximize profits, if you borrow 150 you paying back 15%. They mask the fee under a instant deposit feature. They give u an option of waiting the better of a week(which defeats the payday advance in general to get the funds  into your account for free which will be deducted from ur account in two more additional days for payback .

Too many glitches,2019-07-26 09:14:04,3,False,"Super frustrated. When trying to add my debit card as an alternative payment method so I can receive instacash, it says it was added, but then the screen freezes and the card doesn’t appear to be saved. Can’t request the instacash because of this.

*update*
12 hours later, and it the debit card now shows that it is saved under alternative payment methods. I do want to note that in order to even add the card, I had to log into the money lion WEBSITE and add it to my wallet there. Now after 12 hours it seems to have been updated in the app, and I was able to request the instacash, finally. This truly did take too long, and was not efficient. Hoping this is no longer a problem in the future since the card is saved now in my money lion wallet.

Used money lion for 6 months.,2019-10-29 15:26:43,1,False,I would only recommend this app if you want to stay in debt I paid off my loan early because I felt like it was a trap I never in my life felt so inslaved with a $500 loan. I have other loans in excess of 10k and thoes felt normal. If you want to save money and not live paycheck to paycheck just save your money instead of taking out payday loans or a small 500 loan. It wasnt the interest rate that was the issue. It was the fees and the fact that you have to open the app every day to get a dollar back that made it feel worse than a demanding boss. I paid it off and closed my account the weight on my shoulder was listed. I have my life back. This sounds crazy but it's true. I will never sign up for something like this again.,Xeval,

Next day rolls around, and I call MULTIPLE times throughout the day to talk to someone and no one answers. They’re “busy.” Waited over an hour for each of those calls. Submitted more tickets to talk to someone. No answer. 

The next day, I did the same thing as the past 2 days. Still can’t get in touch with a single person. It’s ridiculous. I’m just trying to get stuff updated on my account, but no one wants to answer the phones or talk over live support on the website.

It’s virtually impossible to get ahold of anyone for any reason, and their support is pretty much a joke. I’ve yet to receive a response that’s not canned.

"They don’t care about you, only your money",2018-02-05 20:48:14,1,False,"The company is dishonest, the original offer they sent me in the mail was for far more than I actually got, even though the mailing said that I was “guaranteed” to get that amount mentioned in the mail. The payments aren’t all that high, until you do the math and see that I basically paid the loan back 3 times in 6 months, since it’s over 300% interest.

They keep you hooked with the false promises of this “money lion plus” that you’re guaranteed to get if you pay your loan off. I made every single payment on time and they never had an issue out of me, but somehow I’m not qualified for money lion plus. 

Now today, my app won’t even open. Probably because they’ve gotten what they wanted out of me, my money.

Deleted the app and reinstalled. App still crashing. One would think that a company bringing in billions every year from extorting hard working people out of their paychecks would have an app that at least works.

Way too much for horrible service and little advantages,2019-12-20 13:07:56,1,False,I had an issue with my bank so I had this app use instacash to transfer me quick funds well I needed it now and not later so I chose the $4.99 method to get paid instantly rather than days well they still haven’t transferred my funds it says it’s still being processed 24 hours later I even paid extra to get the funds immediately not to mention the $9.99 a month I pay to even use this feature this app is a joke and I will be canceling my service immediately once the funds come in and I give it right back to them please don’t use this app they won’t even respond to you when you try to talk to them,Defectiveslayer6,"{'id': 12514155, 'body': ""We're sorry to hear you're experiencing problems with your account.

Horrible service,2019-08-12 17:21:39,1,False,I have a lion plus loan with this company. I changed banks back on 6/1 and needed my account updated. I tried 6 times to try to setup my new card and bank account number. I tried to call several times with no call back like their system advises they will to since no one is ever available. I then get a credit report update stating I was late on my payments even though I have been trying to update my card info for 3 months. My score dropped 57 point because of this. This is a horrible company and I would never suggest them. They are a nightmare. Oh and my I add I still haven’t received a call back nor a update on my account that they changed my card info.,horrible service19,
Just the absolute worst,2019-05-22 07:41:08,1,False,"I’ve never been more disappointed in an app. So much promise. So many days waiting on support to get around to updating my birthday so I could apply (not allowed to change it myself). Had the app (I can’t say service because there wasn’t any) for around 7-10 days, couldn’t get a deposit to go through. Couldn’t change my depositing bank or debit card in the app or website (not allowed to change that for myself either). Couldn’t sign up for Plus. Couldn’t sign up for Core. Also, they changed my mailing address for me... which I did not ask them to do. Thanks guys. Thanks a million. Because I also can’t change that for myself with the new version.",el_presidente720,
Credit Score,2019-05-15 19:24:46,2,False,"Hurt my credit score more than helped it. Ran into an issue with my bank account and MoneyLion is revolving, so you’ll find yourself lost between payments of investments vs MoneyLion fee and they can’t close out investments until loan is paid off. Even if you invested more than what u owe. I would suggest a secured credit card to build credit. The 5.99% loan sounds good but you need to pay 20-30$ a month to get that loan, understand that budget first. Credit score dropped 32 points today with Money lion reporting a late payment since I switched banks. Forgot to update bank info but MoneyLion just kept going with no activity or contact.",traviscurren,
Worst App,2018-10-06 21:27:22,1,False,Great concept but what a joke. I’ve tried a week to signup for a plus account just for the mobile app to say error connection on the final step on the mobile version. I tried the web version like support suggested and when I click the final agreement it just loads! I even waited 2 hours twice and nothing. They gladly take my information and social security number with ZERO ISSUES. I’m calling this app a scam. They take my information and social but other than that this app has done nothing else. I definitely won’t recommend and advise anyone who asks me to steer clear. I know y’all get some kind of kickback for me giving my info and social.

Constant “bank account not detected”,2020-02-22 10:43:01,3,False,"Every two weeks when I get paid the app always says bank account not detected after I pay my instacash balance. By it not detecting my bank account it makes it to where I’m only eligible for a $25 advance compared to $125. I’m also paying $20 a month for my membership and the instacash is supposed to be a benefit of my membership. I have qualifying direct deposits and have my bank account connected, MoneyLion needs to get this sorted out or they will lose me as a customer. Other than that issue I loved the app!

DONT BOTHER NOT WORTH THE FEES OR ZHASSLE,2019-12-17 18:41:37,1,False,MoneyLion makes itself look like a savior with deceptive marketing. You can get “up to” $250 cash advance if you agree to hand over direct deposit information. This deposit ONLY gets deposited in your MoneyLion checking account that they force you to have. You have to pay membership fee to maintain this account. If you miss a payment on your “credit builder loan” they charge a $30 return charge fee to your bank WHO ALSO charges a fee. You only get $150 of the $500 loan. ***THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS OUT SOURCED OVER SEAS TO INDIANS.*** ABD THE WAIT TIME TO SPEAK WITH SOMEONE IS ASININE!!!! Their fees will run you a minimum of $50 a month and you make loan payments bi-weekly of $2. If you don’t mind all of these fees and crappy customer service SIGN UP!!!!,purpleprincezz10,
Customer service doesn’t exist.,2019-08-02 18:52:43,1,False,"I went through the process of creating an account which was unsuccessful and customer service responds with an email about how my account was created in an expired state due to a technical event and they’ll get back to me once is fixed but one month later and that never happened so I requested that they delete my account which they were able to do instantly, funny how that works.

Beware of the forced membership!,2019-07-29 16:32:18,1,False,"It was not clear that, in taking out a loan, I would also be paying for a “membership” that is more expensive than my loan payments which will ALSO be taken out bi-weekly!

But you're not paying back $20 as you think you would be. The membership costs more than the loan payments and it comes out the same date and time as the loan payments.

Awesome Service For Rebuilding Credit,2018-09-23 15:44:48,5,False,"I have been a MoneyLion client since May and I have found this service to be very beneficial and resourceful in the journey to rebuilding my credit history. I also like the investment option which after your loan has been paid back, it allows you access to your money which can be rolled over. One thing to denote is that this loan is reported to the three credit reporting agencies so on time payments are key to good credit health.",Bone diggs,
Good Small Lender,2021-01-13 07:15:23,5,False,"Definitely a new way to borrow and grow your money. It’s almost tempting to borrow, tip, put the money in the market, and borrow more, but you don’t have enough control over your investments so it’s not as exciting as some of the other lenders or stock apps. I use a lot of these types of banks as an attempt to get off of a Big Bank, this is the most generous small and short term lender with an app. They’re not overly in your data like others.",mr.cisnerbros,"{'id': 20481348, 'body': 'Our Pride is over here smiling from mane to mane!

From Investments, to savings to even a checking account, to all the loan options (payday, or 500 dollar loan) they’re all grreeat! The only I REALLY DISLIKE, so their “customer support” it honestly feels like your talking to robots who just copy and past answers to question or concerns we have.

I called customer support, and they told me they can’t have me send copies of my identification to them (unlike most online banks). They suggested that I reapply a week later, after purchasing a copy of my public record from the dmv. So I did. And I got the same error, but this time I knew everything was right.

Great Money Saver/Investment/Loan App,2019-04-04 06:18:45,5,False,I’ve been using this app for almost 1 year now and by far I am not disappointed. Every time you log in everyday you get $1 cash back.

Overall good,2019-02-25 13:50:44,2,False,MoneyLion is good overall but could use a lot of improvements. For example they change your pay date without informing you if it lands in a weekend. They should allow you to pay off you loan balance with your investment accounts. They don’t take long to take money but if you cash anything out it takes 5-7 and it’s usually 7 days. The good is they will give you a loan immediately and they money back is cool daily. I also have a checking account with them as well.

how long it takes to process a transaction when they take your loan payment... Even though your payment is due on the 8th of the month or the 21st of the month, the $79 membership fee and $X payment of the loan amount will be pulled out from your account 48 hours prior to your actual ‘due date’. 
Also, I’ve changed ‘external accounts’ so my loan payment gets taken from one of my bank accounts but the original bank account I have it is still listed for some odd reason. And I’ve tried removing it multiple times and its still there.

"Great idea, laughable execution",2019-06-03 17:22:31,1,False,"I wanted to like MoneyLion. I really did. The idea of having an all-in-one financial app that helped me build credit and save was actually exciting. 

It was awesome, exciting, and useful. Until it wasn’t. 

I’ve had funds pulled on the wrong dates multiple times (one time resulted in my membership being frozen for over a week, despite the fact that this was MoneyLion’s error). Add to that, their much-touted InstaCash feature rarely works properly and, when it does, the app tries to aggressively guilt you in to tipping them (no doubt to get around usury laws). 

Also, customer service is non-existent. The live chat function has never once worked for me, expect a 30 minute hold time if you call them (if you can find the number), OR you can wait three days for an email back from someone who didn’t even read your request (yay generic form emails!!!). 

I’d advise to stay away until the kinks can be worked out. In the meantime, I’m moving my accounts elsewhere.

When I call of course, I’m waiting and waiting and waiting.  My credit score has dropped so much and it’s all because of constant miscommunication between their systems.

Fantastic app for an extraordinary service,2020-01-24 22:18:43,5,False,"These guys have it nailed down to what an alternative banking system should be. The app is flawless, the services on the checking account and the ability to grab small advances between paychecks are great, but they do all of this and fees are pretty much all voluntary. (i.e. optional tip for providing an instant paycheck advance deposit to your checking account). 

The slam dunks though are the debit card for your checking account.  A REAL checking account. It is not a prepaid Visa card like some other services. 

What took the cake though was a call to customer service, which instantly connected me to a rep in the US. He was super friendly, and took care of the issue immediately!

They’ll steal your investments with hidden fees,2019-11-08 01:15:42,1,False,They’ll also sell you to predatory lending companies and sell you information to advertisers. Most likely investing in them long term will lead to identity theft and loss of retirement at an age where you can’t work it back. Do yourself a favor and move on. They stole my investment because I refused their horrible checking account. After months using there membership and investment account they forced me into a new agreement without my consent. Now they are withholding my investment unless I reactivate the membership. They will use your investments to bully you into paying their fees. Do not use this service. You will regret it,Forsythe86,

MoneyLion,2018-10-06 17:29:58,5,False,MoneyLion is great. The investments are easy. The loan cam quick and fast & has been building my credit.

Instacash has saved me,2020-07-14 04:04:32,3,False,I downloaded this solely for the Instacash option and it’s mint. It has saved me from overdraft a couple times the only downside is you’re only allowed to do $50 at a time. So they approved me for $190 so I have to request 4 times to get that. Then you have to “tip” which is $2-$5 (you can choose how much) and then they charge a $5 fee to get it instantly and you have to pay that for every single request.

"Great Banking, Poor Customer Service/Functionality",2020-03-20 21:08:24,3,False,"I love the banking, never had any issues with direct deposit/debit card/instacash. The loan function however has many issues.

1. Miss a loan payment? Good luck trying to pay them. I’ve tried to pay the same missed payment for weeks now. It keeps saying the payment won’t go through, even though I have money to pay it IN MY MONEYLION account. I’ve added my moneylion debit as a payment option with no luck. This hurts my credit. 

2. Customer service is nonexistent. Self explanatory.

I would not recommend taking out a loan with them. The functionality in submitting payments is poor.

Customer Service: Submitted an inquiry Tuesday, but Thursday still have no response even though the response time is listed within one business day. 

For the Services Offered: One of the good models out there. But Moneylion is not for everyone. If you are an experienced investor, go use other brokerage companies. This is mostly for beginning investors or those who wants to save money on the side but is not able to.

The ONLY reason for the two stars rating is the customer service response time. I may update this review once the issues on my account are resolved.",thomascgty,"{'id': 6810417, 'body': 'Hey there thomascgty! We appreciate you taking to time to let us know your feedback.

Great App- Room to improve,2019-04-29 17:52:12,4,False,"The app works wonderfully and I’ve loved the improvements made so far. Ive been a plus member for the better part of a year now and will continue to be as there is value in it. I’ve found it odd and frustrating that I can pay on my loan, invest into my accounts, view my balances no problem but it won’t let me transfer from my bank to the MoneyLion debit card. Totally stupid. I’m hoping the function is broken.",NicholasBroseph,
THE REAL DEAL,2019-01-14 21:17:41,5,False,"Ok I admit I was skeptical at first, however this app is legit. The loan is great for those like me who just turned 18 and needed a way to establish credit. This gives many opportunities to save money. For example: you pay a membership fee but the fee goes to your savings account!! Yes that legit. And if you log in everyday you get $1 cashapp. I’m 300 days in so $300 added to my account. Just try it for thirty days and see yourself",DTheReviewer,
Great saver,2018-08-20 13:08:11,5,False,"I recently downloaded MoneyLion and did research for a day and I needed extra funds due to bills and vacation and they are awesome. I got my loan the next day in the evening like it said I would. Payments are low enough for me, they give you a choice to pay it off in full or you can contact them to pay more. Literally the easiest loan company over ever worked with. Thank you Money Lion for everything !!",linae31,
Don’t forget to check in daily.,2018-07-24 10:40:38,5,False,I really have no complaints about this app. I have been using it for a few months. I have gotten my first loan and I have $180 and change in my investment account. I just have to remember to log in daily and swipe trough my cards to get the free money. I just wish the app would send a reminder for that. Information in the articles is pretty good too.,MossyOakGrl219,
Horrific experience,2018-05-01 01:31:54,5,False,My loan got rejected for 60 to 90 days cause I signed up with one email and couldnt remember which one and hadnt completed the loan app so I resigned up with my other email address and started to complete my loan app and because there was 2 different email addresses they rejected my app for 60 to 90 days according to the so called supervisor.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! MONEY HUNGRY SCAMMERS,2020-06-27 22:27:42,2,False,"Whatever you do, do NOT download MoneyLion. They changed my cash advance payback date (to BEFORE my payday... I only get paid once a month) and I can’t change it back. This resulted in almost $100 in returned check fees from my primary bank. The feature to add a non-Money Lion debit card for cash advance NEVER works but somehow it worked fine adding my debit card to the repayment feature and has no issues deducting from my primary account.

Great app! Has helped my credit AND investment accounts,2019-09-06 16:35:30,5,False,Such a great app and super simple to use. I’ve been with them for about a year now and I have seen drastic improvements in my credit as well as my investment portfolio. I’m looking for ways to possibly set my daughter up with an account because she’s getting ready to go off to college. I highly recommend this app and service.,KrystiP10,
Great at first but now they can’t take the money out,2019-11-05 15:45:56,1,False,"MoneyLion is not too bad. They have great rates and payment plans. I also use the instacash; getting $50. This last time that I requested $50 they have taken the money out of my account twice. I have called and I was told two different things. The first time I was told that they could see the money being taken out of my account on 10/19. Now, they have taken another $55 on 11/04 now they can’t see any payments.

Disappointed,2019-10-18 13:14:37,1,False,"At one point this app was incredible and still has potential. But it’s pretty much a scam. You can do everything outlined and successfully pay off 2 loans, however they WILL NOT guarantee you another or will they honor anything that they “promise” in their advertising. The app is confusing and not always updated or accurate. Customer service is a joke and is extremely rude, if you get through the nearly hour wait to speak to someone. I am so disappointed and can’t see them rectifying my veiws, but I will update my review as soon as they send me my loan. I don’t see that happening though. CONSUMER BEWARE",dammagedaces,

The only negative comment I have, is the inability to use Touch ID anymore. I used to use it. But it stopped working. It might be a glitch. But other than that great app.",Truck monster lover,
Stick to a limit,2020-07-04 15:11:44,2,False,Seriously stop changing the instacash limit everyday choose a limit for a person and set it at that for like a month and then re-evaluated at the end of the month if the person should get an increase or decrease in instacash every week sometimes everyday it’s different last week mine was at 160 now it’s at 115 so that’s 50$ I lost to instacash and it’s so hard to try to get it back up and then you send emails saying “enjoy your boost” and then I go and look and nothing has changed or you uped it by 5$.

I’ve called every week twice a week to get my money back, then they tell you “ we have escalated this issue and will get back to you in 3-5 business days.” This app is ran by rookie customer service reps who can’t do anything outside of change your address.

Great Company!,2019-05-20 22:14:31,5,False,The basis of the company is to give people with less than perfect or no credit a jumpstart. You get a 500 dollar loan at a low rate of interest. All you do is pay a membership fee and all of which goes into savings if you log In everyday. So they help you build savings and give you a loan to establish credit. It’s not a bad deal I started with a 520 and as of this writing I’m up to 644.,Maze69#1,
What customer service? (Terrible),2019-07-11 18:38:22,1,False,I have been trying to get my questions answered about my loan and every time I submit a ticket it directs me to the forum and app. If my answer could be answered by the forum or FAQ then I wouldn’t have to ask it. It worse when you send the question several (over 3 times) and you get the same response. It’s almost like there isn’t a person reading them and it just goes by what you pick when they ask reason.

Good app,2019-06-07 10:41:32,4,False,I love this app it’s great and helping build Credi while investing is not a bad plus either. My only issues is that you don’t have an option to pay more back on a loan like I would have to go through and wait on the phone or for an email back just to wanna pay 50 bucks back on my loan instead of the regular 19 or so. I fee their should be an other option to make it easier. Other than that app is great,asiamymy,

Moneylion Product Review,2019-05-15 05:28:08,4,False,"1=bad 5=excellent

Ease of use: 5
Affordability of Pro: 4
Benefits of Pro Service: 5
Referral Rewards: 4
Investment Portfolio Gains: 4

 Total: 22/25, very helpful app! The loan for the pro service helps a ton with (re)building credit and the APR is barely noticeable.

  I tend to wait for the loan to be half paid off, before I pay off the rest. The reason, being, that you can’t touch the $ in your investment portfolio -until there’s no active loans. 

  However, after paying off the loan, I pull out all of the extra invested $, besides what you need to reapply for loan. This way I end up getting a few hundred back from my investments saved and use it to replace the $ I used to pay off the loan. Then I get the new loan, so I end up with a fresh ~$500 into my bank 💪",#THF,

MoneyLion started as a decent service offering credit building loans and some investment incentives with membership.

The investment benefits were taken away within 3 months of having my account.
Customer service is nonexistent, I’ve been hung up on, I’ve waited for 45 mins to speak with someone, I’ve not ever gotten an answer of any use.

Don’t say coming soon if: 
1. They’re obviously not and it’s just a ploy to make people think they’ll be able to actually get there money out. 
2. You can even get your most basic features to work well.

They say you can payback Instacash with an external debit card and then when you do, the app is so broken it’ll say you missed a payment and your benefits are paused and are now ineligible.

Well, well, well ..... MoneyLion customer service reps are the worst to deal with even if you can get ahold of one over the phone. #1 none of the reps that I’ve spoken with are knowledgeable about MoneyLion and it’s services. #2 I’ve literally have waited to speak with a support specialist for longer than 2hrs and sometimes they answer and hang up.

Could use some work,2019-05-21 19:31:46,1,True,The deeper I get into this app the more disappointing it is. There’s a lot I like about this app and a lot that needs improvement. Sometimes the app gets a little buggy and doesn’t update as frequently as I’d like. The resetting of your streak is VERY disappointing. The “e-gift cards” needing to be printed out instead of truly remaining electronic is also pretty disappointing. The low apr loan option is nice but overall I am not impressed anymore. Customer service is a joke. Great potential but it’s definitely nowhere close to being a great company.,bravo-romeo-echo,"{'id': 6810391, 'body': 'Hey there bravo-romeo-echo!

2. I get that they need to show offers to boost sales, but my god is there a lot of what seems like ads. Let people say no thanks to some of the things that they don’t need. I don’t want to drive for Uber. I don’t want you doing my taxes.

You can only contact them via chat in the app. 

It takes literal hours to respond to your chat request, and if you don’t respond in 2-3 minutes when they finally enter chat they close your session and you have to start over.

I have $487 in my investment account. I owe $323 on the loan. I only signed up with money lion in order to help my credit. And had no issues. Until today.

Well, we lost an income and I can no longer keep up with the subscription. I called and spoke to MANY people and I was told they can not use my investment account to pay off the loan. They told me I basically have to default the loan (hurting my credit) and them they can take legal action against me. 

SERIOUSLY!?

The supervisors recommendation was to pay off the loan then liquidate my investment account. 

I’m sorry but I do not have an extra $323 laying around to pay off this loan and THEN wait 7-14 business days for them to give me the money back from the liquidation!

I’ve been trying to cancel my membership. I’ve paid off all my loans but the payment status still haven’t been posted it’s been weeks.  They are doing this on purpose so that they can milk for membership fees.

Pretty terrible customer service all around. Can never get anyone on the phone. A million rules in their fine print. Used to be my favorite app on my phone but now...I weep for their demise.

Bring back the old plan and I might come back. Why anyone would want to use the new one is beyond me. I ain’t paying for trashy services. I was just in here for the managed investment account, but I’ll just move all my money to Charles Schwab now that they do free trading.

Membership payments - required as a member.\n2. Loan payments - if you have an active loan.\n\nMembership Fees:\nTo enroll in Plus and stay in good standing you must pay the monthly membership fee of $29 and invest a required $50/month (or more if your choose) that's deposited directly into your Plus investment account.\n\nThe membership fee will be charged as long as you remain a member of the program.\n\nFor more information on membership fees, visit the Enrollment & Membership section of this FAQ.\n\nLoan Payments:\nWhen you enroll in Plus, you gain access to a no hassle $500 loan at 5.99% APR.\n\nIf you take this loan, you will be expected to make both your required membership fees as well as your loan payments. Loan payments are also set up to be debited on your pay dates to increase the likelihood of successful payment. In other words, you are making two payments on the same date when you are enrolled and have a loan.\n\nYou will pay these loan payments in addition to the membership fee until the loan is paid off. At this point you can request another $500 loan at the same APR. Note you can pay off your Plus loan in full early or make additional payments to complete your loan requirements faster and pay less interest on the loan."", 'modified': '2019-03-27T21:33:46Z'}"

Loan payments - if you have an active loan.\n\nMembership Fees:\nTo enroll in Plus and stay in good standing you must pay the monthly membership fee of $29 and invest a required $50/month (or more if your choose) that's deposited directly into your Plus investment account.\n\nThe membership fee will be charged as long as you remain a member of the program.\n\nFor more information on membership fees, visit the Enrollment & Membership section of this FAQ.\n\nLoan Payments:\nWhen you enroll in Plus, you gain access to a no hassle $500 loan at 5.99% APR.\n\nIf you take this loan, you will be expected to make both your required membership fees as well as your loan payments. Loan payments are also set up to be debited on your pay dates to increase the likelihood of successful payment. In other words, you are making two payments on the same date when you are enrolled and have a loan.\n\nYou will pay these loan payments in addition to the membership fee until the loan is paid off. At this point you can request another $500 loan at the same APR. Note you can pay off your Plus loan in full early or make additional payments to complete your loan requirements faster and pay less interest on the loan.\n\nYou can visit the MoneyLion Plus Loan section of the FAQ for more details on loan payments."", 'modified': '2019-03-27T19:57:01Z'}"

Litigation likely to follow.,coltonjsmith,"{'id': 6871829, 'body': ""Hi coltonjsmith! Thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback. We'd love to clarify how the MoneyLion Plus membership, fees, benefits and exactly where your money is going. In regards to the MoneyLion checking account, that is a benefit of having a MoneyLion Plus membership but you are not required to have a checking account with MoneyLion but if you are interested, that is a separate application. There are no fees charged by MoneyLion in order to have that account and you won't be charged any overdraft/NSF fees as well. \nThe monthly charge to have a MoneyLion Plus membership comes out to be about $79. We take $50 of that and place it into an investment account (so it is still your money). That would leave $29 for how much the membership does actually cost. You can subsidize that $29 fee by logging into your mobile app every day and receiving your $1 daily cashback (which we also place into your investment account for you). You do have the option to withdrawal from your investment account as well, we simply ask that you keep $150 in your investment account and if you have an active loan out you must have less due than that which you are attempting to withdraw. For example, if you have $900 in your investment account currently, but you have $300 due on your loan through MoneyLion Plus as well, then you would have $450 dollars available. \nIf any questions arise or assistance is needed, feel free to contact us at 1-888-704-6970 or email us at support@moneylion.com."", 'modified': '2019-01-16T22:26:41Z'}"

We appreciate you taking the time to leave us with this review but we'd be happy to clarify. We do always advise that each of our members familiarize themselves with our products at support.moneylion.com. If using a MoneyLion Plus membership, you are required to keep $150 in your investment account and if an active loan has been taken out using the membership, the amount due has to be lower than the request made for withdrawal as well. An example would be if $900 was available in your investment account but you had $300 left of payments on your loan. You would deduct $150 and $300 from your $900 leaving you with $450 available for withdrawal. If any questions arise or assistance is needed, feel free to contact us at 1-888-704-6970 or email us at support@moneylion.com."", 'modified': '2019-01-15T18:01:59Z'}"

Horrendous Customer Sevrvice,2020-03-05 20:50:32,1,False,ML+ is NOT Worth the $20/month Membership. I’ve used this app for over a Year and it is terrible in every sense of the word. I’m embarrassed that I continue to pay the monthly rate in hopes of it paying off one day but the 2 weeks for a customer service reply to 2hrs waiting on hold to talk to someone who didn’t have any answers.,BigPlayKa,

Worst. Customer. Service. Ever.,2019-11-19 20:34:13,1,False,For such a highly rated app you’d think one of these people could email me back. An instacash payment came out A WEEK AGO and was never reflected on my money lion account which is now past due. I have emailed them several times and tried to contact them through Facebook and gotten no response.,Alexander Nathaniel Martin,"{'id': 12938636, 'body': ""Good day!
