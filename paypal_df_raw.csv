It will then ask me if I want to auto log in for future transactions on this device. I always check yes and it will work for a while but eventually revert to making me log in every time for every single transaction. 

Also I’ve been disappointed with PayPal for some of the scammer vendors that use PayPal. There have been a few that me and many other PayPal customers have complained about through the PayPal Community in Disputes and Limitations for which PP seems to turn a blind eye. One Chinese vendor used a false address and didn’t send the right product (actually sent unusable pieces that didn’t even go together) and then refused to allow me to return it and only offered me a fraction of the price as a refund. When reading other complaints, it’s so obvious that their business practice is simply a scam and that it has no intention of providing anyone with a real product. Yet PayPal continues to allow them to do business through them. Why I can not understand. I’ve actually considered closing my account. I use PP for the convenience but I also felt using it would be a bit more secure and reputable.

1. No telephone service during COVID-19. I get it, people were staying at home. But as someone who works for a humble non-profit, my employer was quick to find solutions for workers to keep their jobs while working from home. PayPal obviously didn’t do this. They were no longer offering help via phone, so talking to a human instead of texting was out of the question. I had to make a Twitter account and tweet at the PayPal Twitter account to get their attention. I don’t own or use Twitter, so it was troublesome to have to go to that sort of work to get my money back after I was the victim of a scam. 

2. Like every other website on the planet, PayPal is obsessed with the idea that they’ve already answered your question. It’s difficult to even get in touch with someone through their help center, because they want to push their FAQ on you instead of allowing you to just ask your question. I have NEVER found the answers in FAQ, typically because when I need help it’s because I’ve already exhausted common sense options.

"First, I would clarify that this app & company are almost 5 star for consumers with one minor issue being trying to address a problem or issue quickly with an actual customer service person. A lot of the common things can be done right in the app and additional automated processes are available on their full website (via Resolution Center usually). However, if you are using it as a Seller, you have to be prepared to have a good cash flow to cover resolutions pending, and occasionally are blocked access to your funds if an issue is being investigated like a customer complaint, even when not your issue. Sometimes for 10 or more days they can hold your funds hostage while you wait for their CS dept to investigate, allow for additional input deadlines to expire and then wait for a response/ judgement. I know it’s for the benefit of the consumer but in cases where you have abusive or not-so-honest consumers, it can be a challenge for a small business with small cash flow. And cash flow can easily kill a small business that is otherwise successful. So it’s still a good app but caution for some people who use it for business",11/28/2020 17:24,4,FALSE,m89aria,Great for buyers/consumers,

PayPal is a great app when you have to pay for something online. They can help you if you buy something that isn’t as advertised but there are issues. I purchased a Nintendo switch back in March from a website that looked legit. I paid a little over $250 for a basic used Nintendo switch. An hour later I got a delivery confirmation. I immediately new something was wrong and tried to get in touch with someone to have them stop the transaction. But I couldn’t get ahold of a person. I was stuck with there automated system. But eventually I did get a human about two months later. They asked why I hadn’t contacted them sooner and said well I tried but their automated system wouldn’t let me through. Long story short I never got my money back. Now my cousin has sent me $100 dollars for Christmas and PayPal put a hold on it. Like it’s a gift I wasn’t selling anything. Why put it on hold. That was at the begging of January and they say they can’t release it until February 1. I like a lot of there features but sometimes it’s not worth using there service because of the nonsense and the lack of them doing what they say they will when it comes to satisfaction guarantees.,1/23/2021 23:58,3,FALSE,IAMCornholieO129,Pretty good but could be better,
"I received a notification from my PayPal app that there was an eBay charge on my account of $75. I have literally never bought anything on eBay so I looked for some sort of dispute option. At first, there was no option to dispute on PayPal, it kept sending me to eBays site, it gave me eBay’s phone number (which when I called was a voice message giving me eBays website with no human customer service option.) I sent an email to eBay support which has not been answered, and finally I was able to open a dispute on PayPal’s site (which has not been answered) and I’ve yet to find a number to call for human support. Although it’s easy to blame eBay, PayPal is the one who had my bank information; they allowed eBay to steal from me with absolutely no safeguards or even an “approve transaction” pop up. PayPal stole $75 from me and most likely I will never get it back; and there isn’t even a human being I can call to ask for it back. I’m blessed to have a good job, and the $75 really doesn’t mean much to me financially. But I have been poor and broke and homeless and I know that $75 could be the difference between eating and starving for a lot of people.

Except the only option this insane company gives me is a phone number that’s not been mine for at least 6 years. So I try the contract is option to get help recovering the password. Two options are given, message or call. Unfortunately the guy who designed the plan for this sort of situation didn’t let the lack of rational thought and at only allowing a years old phone number be used to reset. No, in a shocking display of how to ensure you are the least user friendly as possible, the two contact is options require one to be logged in to receive assistance.

"Protecting information systems is key. The triad of cyber security consists of these; Confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality keeps unauthorized users away from the information.

I use PayPal pretty much all the time at least where it is available to be used bring up my 1st & probably the biggest con is that only 1/2 of the online shops I use have / give methe option of being able to pay via PayPal or Credit / Debit card. The 2nd con is that it takes a 1% charge of the amount if the amount is being transferred from PayPal to my bank within mins or for no fee 3 days to get transferred which goes to the 3rd which is that if I need to send money to my family members or friends PayPal account then I need to have the funds in PayPal otherwise It cost me extra if I have to send using my credit/ Debit card.

So PayPal got conned because the guy's bank gave him his money back. Now PayPal has locked my account, made it a $400 negative balance and send my information to collection agency.

"I enjoy using PayPal, it’s easy and pretty much works as if you had a checking account with a financial institution. There is one flaw to my disliking; the amount of time it takes to transfer money from your financial institution account to your PayPal account. It states it can take up to 5 business days. It does take 5 business days which is sometimes frustrating especially when your financial institution account has already been verified and used repeatedly to transfer money from bank account to PayPal. 
So my question/concern is why does it take so long when accounts are already verified and linked up together? 
And when accounts are linked together like that and your systems are communicating with the other financial institutions. Doesn’t that fall under what is to be considered as SurePay? 
Where as a financial banking institution have processing cut off times in order for a check to be  deposited and available next business day or the following day as long as it is a verifiable check/transfer either through SurePay or manual verification methods. 
Other than that I like my PayPal accts. And hopefully in the near future PayPal’s processing times and dates on a money transfer ucgo from 5+ days down to a 48 hour processing turnaround.

From unjust business practices to terrible customer support PayPal all around is a great service to use if you don’t want to get anywhere.

This was of course after waiting for months for a response. I also believe that they require you to add additional information to upsell you on future things they try to market to you.

Took near a month to arrive, but I excused that because it was China. But when I got them, they were just regular summer shorts, and nothing like the ad. The seller was hard enough to contact through email. I’m thinking I was being ignored. So I escalated to PayPal. After days of waiting, PayPal says the seller wants the item returned and then they’ll give a refund. Now, keep in mind I’m in the US, and they want me to ship a package I don’t want to China, and pay for it myself.

As a seller, customers now know that all they have to do is make a false claim with no information backing it up and paypal will side with the buyer. I even submitted 5 forms of evidence and the buyer provided nothing. Buyer was refunded their purchase price even though a refund was currently being processed through eBay so now buyer has their money, the item they never had any intentions on sending back, and PayPal charged the seller a $20 penalty fee for being scammed.

For context, the system requires you to confirm two small deposits that were made into your account in order for your bank account to be linked. Without a linked bank account, you have to use a debit/credit card which involves paying a fee that’s proportionate to your payment amount. However, those small deposits are never made into your bank account and customer support has no other solution to allow me to use my bank account.

Customer support has not been easy to communicate with either. Whenever I call their customer support number, it takes about 5-7 minutes to get to the option to speak to a representative.

The vendor told PayPal that I would have to ship the item to China, which would cost more in shipping than the original price of the item. PayPal sided with the vendor, saying that since I didn’t ship the item to China, they could not help me and suggested that I contact the credit card company associated to my PayPal account. At this point so much time had elapsed that the credit card company could not help me. I would have been better off if I had dealt with the credit card company directly instead of using PayPal.

Normally this would only get it reduced to a 2-star, but their approach to cryptocurrency is troubling to say the least- they circumvent the entire purpose of being able to send/receive crypto and do not give you the wallet address for your own funds.

PayPal says they can release money sooner If tracking information is put in the eBay account.

I can contact a real person at eBay and I have talked to them.  eBay says they have no control over PayPal. There is no one to talk to at PayPal and only line of communication is an “automated” chat line which is absolutely useless.

First off the process of finding someone to pay and verifying is hilarious archaic. Even if you already have a transaction history with someone you can’t pay or request from that page.. you STILL have to go back to search for them with their email, hopefully it’s the same person!

Second off, the app defaults to considering and money sent is a purchase, not a personal money transaction like sending your friend some dinner cash or rent. This means they CHARGE THE RECIPIENT a sales fee. So hope your friend or landlord or whoever enjoys actually receiving only a fraction of what you sent.

Lastly, did you realize this is kind of a raw deal? Want to cancel the transaction or have your friend “refund” you so you can pay them some other way? GOOD LUCK. Because when you pay them, the money comes immediately out of your bank account and goes into their “pay pal wallet”. If they want to issue a “refund” or cancel, the money has to come from.... THE RECIPIENTS BANK ACCOUNT. That’s right so now you’re both out double the money you originally sent from your bank accounts.

This is not a service you want to use if you are a business owner, small or large. There is a reason businesses are suspending their partnership with PayPal, because it’s absolutely terrible for merchants.

PayPal makes it difficult for NEW accounts to process transactions, with their constant limitations. Your account must be in excellent standing and have a good history. You might as well just purchase an account from the deep web because for a new business this is very difficult.

PayPal provides no tools for merchants to filter out risky payments, there is no chargeback protection, and anyone can terminate your account by spamming chargebacks.

PayPal refuses to understand and cooperate with the merchant, they will never tell you what a problem is with your account.

The one HUGE GLITCH is that, if we change our “Default Payment Source”, it does not change the prior payment agreements set up. 
Okay, agreements are agreements.
But, PAYPAL, dear, please have your developers design a *WARNING* that this is the way it is?
The *WARNING* needs to arrive at any or ALL of these places: 
-When automatic payment agreements are set up/changed
-When default payment sources are set up/changed
-When verification emails for either of the above are sent out

I can’t get my money out. There is a hold placed on my funds for no apparent reason. PayPal has held my money with no reason. I was told by customer service the only way to find out why they will not release my money is to file a subpoena!!! I’ve read story’s where PayPal withheld $40,000 from someone else. My case is less but this company is corrupt. This is not the PayPal of old. Read PayPal’s better business bureau reports. They are full of cases like this. They say they can hold the money almost a year!! With no explication.

Secondly, PayPal owns Venmo, the company responsible for loads of identity theft due to there policy of sharing your transaction information by default!!! Yeah... like anyone can see your stuff. Thanks again. Venmo admits that they have received complaints but yet continue this security lapse regardless.

Let’s face it, they don’t care about you at all

This app is horrible.  So confusing.  So slow.  If you need the money right away PayPal is the last app to use.  And this last transfer I did the 1-3 days free transfer to the bank and it tells me it will be deposited in 5 days 🤔🤔.  Also makes you wait up to 3 weeks if you are a first timer.  I sold something and waiting the period.  Then tried again thinking since the sale went smooth I wouldn’t have to wait that probationary period.  That was on the 3rd.  Still “on hold”.  Just the worst payment app possible,3/12/2021 3:07,1,FALSE,Venmo way better,Terrible,
