1,"Klarna works great and does exactly what it is supposed to - until you have a problem and have to deal with their customer service.  I received a refund for a cancelled event back in September, but was shorted one of my refund payments. I talked to my bank and they told me exactly what the problem was. Klarna won’t even acknowledge my problem - in fact, they don’t even keep a record that there *was* a problem.  I have had to fully explain what was going on every single time, including the fact that they saw where the deposit was attempted and then cancelled by Klarna.  To date I have spent nearly 20 hours in chat or on hold waiting for “specialists” who can actually look at the full transaction records. When I do finally receive a response, they tell me to contact my bank and come back with what they say with no record or acknowledgment that I had already told them exactly what the problem was several times already.  Want to tell the specialist directly?  Nope they close the ticket as soon as you get an e-mail or  response from a specialist.  Specialist doesn’t reply?  After seven days they automatically delete your ticket and you go to the back of the line.  Do business with them at your own risk, because if there is an issue you can look forward to being ignored and ran in circles.",FALSE,Bob robertson,Worst Customer Service I have ever seen!,12/5/2020 18:45,"{'id': 19570774, 'body': 'Hello, \r\n\r\nWe would be happy to assist further regarding this issue. \r\n\r\nPlease reach out to our customer service team via phone or chat. \r\n\r\nHave a good day.

1,"Horrible experience. My debit card I had linked to my purchase was stolen and I had to wait for another to be sent. In the mean time I linked my bank account so my Klarna payment still could be taken from my account- but with out disclosing this when I added by bank account, bank accounts can not be used to make payments, only to pay off accounts in full- so I was charged a late fee. I spent an entire week trying to get this late fee removed by customer service spending 30 minutes a day for 4 days on chat asking for help removing the late fee. Each customer service rep said the late fee was actually removed and by a glitch I still saw it on my account. I was told countless times it was a glitch and would not actually charge me, then I was charged the late fee after hours of work trying to prevent it to happen. I am still waiting for my late fee to be returned to be and my case was closed and “sent to management” now what. Apparently they will email me on Monday but after what I have experienced, I am holding my breath. Lots of work for getting my $7 back. 

This experience was not worth the service Klarna provided and I suggest that others do not use Klarna in risk this same thing happens to them.

5,"I super super love using KLARNA. With the pandemic going on, a lot of us.. most of us... are struggling with financial hardships. It’s really difficult sometimes to focus on which we should be prioritizing first especially those who have family to take care of, bills to pay, rent ,mortgage , car payments and more. But we sure need to pamper ourselves too. With the tight budget, we cannot afford to buy things even if we really wanted to because we need to attend to our financial obligations to our family. Thank God there’s KLARNA. We can shop and we don’t have to worry about paying bigger amount upfront. Klarna helps big time with people like me. Because with Klarna, we can buy things and we don’t need to feel guilty about burning money in one time payment. The pandemic is triggering a lot of anxiety, stress, depression etc etc... but with the help of Klarna, we can do a little retail therapy to indulge ourselves or reward ourselves for doing a good job surviving this Global Pandemic. Thank you so much Klarna for all you guys do. Very helpful,very reliable, very efficient and trustworthy.",FALSE,peopledoexist,Heaven Sent,2/16/2021 17:29,
1,"I used this for a few purchases over a few months time span and paid everything back on time with automated debits. Then, suddenly it won’t approve one time cards or purchases saying that I need to choose a different payment method. I have a bank account, a Chime account, and my debit card from the bank account mentioned. Never lets me use the app any longer. I am always redirected to send a customer service message and it doesn’t let me just chat with someone. These are declines for a purchase; just tells me I need to choose a different payment method. So, it seems like they are now limiting approval based on payment methods even if they have been used previously. I thought this was a game changer and it’s just like everything else. Works for a short period of time and then just quits. Good luck in the long term.

**update since the developer focused on only one part of my original review**

I have a credit union bank account and debit card for that credit union associated to my account also. Maybe that’s unclear above. For the record, Klarna used to allow Chime because I have past auto payments from that account. But regardless of that, it no longer lets me use the credit union account even after I removed the Chime account. So, try again Klarna.",TRUE,Elliepantz62,It works for a bit and then just stopped.,4/4/2021 18:52,"{'id': 22034430, 'body': 'We do not currently accept Chime as a form of payment.

1,"This app started great, I was so fascinating with it but in less than two months has become a huge disappointment. As other reviewers said they don’t tell you how much you are approve for and then all of the sudden they stop authorizing purchases even though you keep making payments. Got in touch with two reps by chat (no telephone number to be reach which is very frustrating) and they told me to wait between 1-2 hours for the problem to be solved and nothing... also, to delete and download the app again to see if works and nothing... they don’t even know why the system would not approve and can’t even do anything about it cause they can’t override. Its  a waste of time talking to them. Definitely will go back to Afterpay NEVER had an issue with them and it’s always been easy to communicate with them (they do have a customer service number if you need to speak to them) it has been a very frustrating situation with Klarna and I’m so sorry but this is the end and I will be returning everything I bought through Klarna since I already had to make so many payments to try to resolve the issue that persists about overdue payments.

1,Of course this would happen days before Christmas. I placed an order with Goat via the Klarna app. Was told by Klarna reps that the order was shipped and approved on 12/18. But I never received a confirmation email from Goat. I started to get concerned because Klarna already took money out of my account. On 12/19 I start to get nervous and I contacted Goat. They say they have no record of the order. Went back to Klarna they blamed Goat and said they don’t have any information about the package. But remember I said the first rep told me it was approved by Goat and shipped already. I emailed and used the chat option for 2 more days inquiring for tracking information or just more information in general and no one responded until today 12/23. Klarna rep informs me that the one time card was $3 less than the total which was not true. I made sure the amount was $5 more that the total. The rep pushed for me to cancel. When I mentioned could he just override the one time card he ignore that request/inquiry and all of a sudden my order was cancel.

However, when it comes to a partial refund on big orders, it started to stress me out.

What I don’t like is that when you look at your returned order in the app, it’s not labeled as “processing refund” or anything like that, but just “the amount for this purchase has changed”, I can’t see the amount of refund, and when will I get it.

So much for “innovation” and it supposedly not being like standard line of credit issuers. Just pay in full at once or order what you need in increments yourself—Klarna doesn’t want nor need your business.

Update: Still terrible. Unlike Afterpay (their superior competitor), Klarna doesn’t disclose to you anywhere what your spending limit is with them. Instead, they want you to guess and jump through hoops in the hopes of paying off enough of your “pay in four” (defeats the purpose of installment payments when you’re forced to pay off everything in full at once before you can get a paltry credit) orders before you can try to use them again.

5,"Hi so I have noticed some people not understanding how you can use klarna which is fair because I didn’t either at first. There are many places you may be wanting to shop at that are not supported by Klarna and might not say Klarna as a payment option. This is where one time cards are used. For example, I ordered from shein, and wanted to use Klarna. I use the shein app because it is a lot easier to shop that way than through Klarna. I made a one time card, put the amount I was spending and it processes it like a credit or debit would but you can pay the rest later. It has to be at least the amount you are spending or if it is over you can reduce after using it but it’s my favorite app for shopping.

I’ve made nearly $800 worth of purchases since April, all purchases have been paid off (except $35 of it for a purchase I made LAST week).

Refunds definitely could be handled better and more efficient. Other than that I’m happy with Klarna. Updated from one to four stars. !!!

That was until late a March of 2020, I’m not sure if the economy tanking or millions losing their jobs has influenced Klarna to reject loyal customers, but, I am thinking that is not the smartest thing Klarna can do. Why would you deny ghost cards to customers that never had issues with them and have a good payment history???. That is beyond comprehension and I just wish they would understand the gravity of their error. Afterpay has taken my business and even though it is more limited than Klarna I am happy with Afterpay.

As an update to this review. Apparently Klarna really does not care about its customers, it seems that you have to have perfect credit score to even qualify to use this app.  
Really great business model to reject users that have never defaulted on payments and always paid on time.

1,They have been just awful so far. I wanted to finance an expensive PC from Lenovo and they marketed Klarna so I applied and got accepted. I use them at checkout and received an email saying thanks for my purchase but no information. So I waited 4 days called both companies and no record of the purchase. So I tried again this time I was charged from Klarna and it had my items in the account “being prepared” but never got an email from Lenovo. I waited 4 more days and no progress changed on my account so I called Lenovo and they said they had no order from me in their system.

1,I will start this by saying that I never had a problem with them in the beginning. However in November I ordered an Apple Watch and paid with Klarna. Apple contacted me saying there was a problem with my payment so I canceled the card and order and made a new one. Even though I have screenshots and emails showing the card was canceled Klarna still is actively charging me for it monthly. I contacted customer service 3 times and so far no one has been able to help me. They keep trying to convince me that the order went though and I in fact have an Apple Watch that I don’t have.

Like for example, I could seamlessly use this app for weeks, make every single payment on time, then out of nowhere I won’t get approved for a ghost card. No explanation given. Then today something really odd happened. I made a ghost card for a purchase with no issue, cancelled it because the merchants website wasn’t accepting the card. So I decided to make another ghost card, for a lesser amount for a completely different website and wasn’t approved. That’s not the weird part, the weird part is I received an email saying that they have pulled my credit to determine if I was eligible for a ghost card. First off, I don’t have bad credit, second, is my credit actually being pulled every single time I attempt to make a purchase? It would be my fault for not reading the fine print but that’s insane. I honestly thought apps like these were alternatives to traditional credit cards but if you’re actually placing inquiries on my credit every single time I attempt to make a purchase that’s ridiculous. To make matters worst, customer service never has any answers. You’re always given super vague, generic responses about how the disapproval may be associated with your bank, negative payment history, or just the app denying you for no reason at all. Super strange, and sketchy. I guess I’ll continue to use Quadpay and Afterpay.

3,"then they stopped supporting all of my cards/banks. I have no complaints about their customer service, always friendly and you can get ahold of someone within minutes through the chat feature. However they’ve also taken away the ability to pay your payments early, but high is often what I do I try to pay everything off for the week when I get my paycheque. Sometimes money isn’t in my account later in the week on the proper date if I have to just wait for it to come out on its own— you should definitely be able to make payments whenever you want 🤷‍♀️ wth. Another thing is if you miss a payment, they make it so that you can’t just fix that, now it’s going to come out with the next payment, and if you want to pay it now, you have to pay both at once. They will add fees to your total if you don’t pay it off within a week I think, but the larger payment is harder to pay off and then the fee can make it even more difficult— I really don’t think this is the best technique for their demographic (people who actually need to use this app, and split things into bite-sized chunks they can manage), because the fees can just start piling up and while the total gets larger your ability to pay it off gets smaller. They should do the exact opposite, since clearly you couldn’t make a payment, add a fee if they don’t correct it within a certain time period and then maybe do a courtesy offer once a month if this happens, where the payment is split one more time so you only have to pay half this time since you’re low on funds.
