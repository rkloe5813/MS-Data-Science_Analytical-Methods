FALSE,Zldnosnsk,5,5/12/2020 12:24,"I really do like this app. I am one that hates banks and how they allow accounts to go over then charge people overdraft fees. It’s literally taking money from people who have none and that should be a crime. Chime doesn’t do that and they actually do prioritize their customers. I think this is a revolutionary app for banking. I hope it picks up traction and changes how banking is done completely. 

The direct deposit is fantastic. You do get your money early thanks to Chime and it definitely helps. They also have the “round up & save” feature for people who struggle to save money. 

My only problem with it is that it takes far too long to transfer money. Like a week to transfer. And they have a very small daily limit for transferring (like $200). It can become frustrating when I’m trying to budget my money by separating bill money from spendable money.  They keep saying it’s just the banking system, and I know they must have to make some sacrifices in order to be able to provide such great services without all the fees banks drop on us. I just wish there were options to pay a fee for an instant transfer to your bank like Venmo or Ca$h App. I’m sure with increased popularity eventually somewhere along the line of updates will be an option for instant transfers. It just doesn’t exist now.","Pretty good, takes too long to transfer money though",
FALSE,HarmonyLynnSeidl1998,5,3/12/2020 7:44,"I have been with Chime for quite some time now and let me tell ya, when I say they are amazing... THEY ARE AMAZING!! I was with a Credit Union for a little while and they told me I was set up with an account that I couldn’t over draft in... yet every payday I was magically some odd amount in the negative. It NEVER failed! Then, I decided to give Chime a chance and see what happened. NOT ONLY do they not charge fees but they have this really cool setting that makes it SUPER easy to
save called “Round Up” and basically what that does is every time you add money to your account it saves a percentage of that amount. Which is BEYOND helpful. It does the same when you spend money as well, except, it rounds up to the next dollar amount I believe.  Their customer support via Phone/Email is FANTASTIC! The workers are so sweet and helpful and anytime I’ve had to call they fixed what ever I needed! I’ve only had to call them twice and neither were to complain but to figure out something or get an answer to a question I didn’t know. 

I’m not gonna lie, at first I thought it was a scam, or just another ad on FB... but I am honestly SO happy that I switched. If it wasn’t for them my taxes would’ve already been fully spent and most of it in fees 😂 I HIGHLY recommend dumping your physical bank and joining Chime. It’s worth it...

FALSE,Teh_Black_One,5,2/6/2021 16:32,"Edit: still so great!

I was nervous about there being no branches and only online but it turned out very smooth. I have both savings options activated and I love it! It takes a bit for the round up though maybe between an hour of the posted transaction to at least 1 business day. But that’s not too annoying. I DID ask for the emailed direct deposit form and it has the old routing number. It was an easy fix and my 2 most recent deposits have come through perfectly fine. I’m a huge lover of Apple Pay so I’m glad it works with that. The mobile check deposit feature works great as well. I received an email the next business day saying my check was received and it’ll be available the next business day. (Good thing I did all of this on a Monday.) You don’t really feel lost or anything using the app it’s very simple. I have only had the service for a couple weeks but so far I am a top fan. I took a star away because the routing number issue delayed my first deposit by one day. Also if you use the chat line for service a different rep replies each time. That also makes me worry a bit of a huge issue occurs that you’d usually go into a branch for. But again so far, it works gloriously!",Great so far!,
FALSE,Cheykim,2,3/3/2021 20:30,"So I opened my chime account in 2019, I loved it at first because of the no overdraft fees and the early pay, but this bank is so annoying to deal with. Not only is their customer service horrible but just trying to get in contact with someone is as well. You spend about 10 minutes on the call menu alone just trying to get through the different options to find the right place. My wallet had gotten stolen so i canceled my credit card and debit card, I then requested a new one, took almost a month to get there. Tried to activate it and was told that the card information was wrong. Okay? Not sure how it would be wrong since it's literally right there on the card. So i contacted a rep through the app, they said they would send another one. Got the new card, tried to activate it AND IT STILL WOULD NOT WORK. Okay, maybe it's just a system error. Got a new card AGAIN a few days later after they expedited it. Tried it activating it again and it still would not work. I decided to close my account after that. It was just too much hassle to try and do it over the phone and not be able to just walk into an actual branch to get my issue resolved. Oh and when I went to close my account, the representative didn't even ask why I was closing my account. You would think that such a highly reviewed ""bank"" would atleast want to know why a dedicated customer is closing their account.",Waste of Time,
FALSE,b.groves99,2,11/25/2020 15:38,"I’ve been with Chime for years now. It was the second bank I’ve ever used. It was awesome in the beginning, I enjoyed the perks like no atm fees and the well designed app. But lately it has gone downhill fast. Starting when they disabled spot me without any notice and at this time I’ve lost my job due to COVID-19. So lately to make ends meet I’ve been making my money through Doordash and instacart and if you do either you know it can be very little amounts you make during certain times of the week. So I had my money transferred into my Chime account, witch was in the negative as it has been a lot lately for me. Well the amount I made witch was only $43 wasn’t even enough to cover my negative balance, witch wasn’t an issue because I had spot me. Well since I never got a notification that they had disabled spot me that $43 I had for the next day or two was gone and I went without the things I needed. I contacted Chime and explained my situation for them to only tell me that there was nothing they could do. After about 30 minutes of arguing, I finally gave up because I was getting no where. So I felt useless to my family and they were perfect okay with that. Now we’re here today, where I need to get the things I need and I cannot access my money yet once again.

Here’s where our buddy’s at chime come in hand, chime let’s you set up a “spot me” option for any of us that tend to go over with out looking or if we’re out here struggling needing some extra dollars before our next pay day.

FALSE,Kryptic Arrow,4,7/8/2020 23:05,"*This bank has been really good so far. No fees like it says and I got my card very quickly. Just two issues I have with it so far. One is that they go through Green Dot for cash deposits. Green Dot charges 4.95 and requires a minimum of 20 to deposit. I hope that they eventually make a kiosk or something that eliminates these fees. Also it doesn’t update your account balance right away. For those of us with bad memory it makes it a little more difficult to budget. I recommend using a notepad app to keep track of your funds until the app updates your account info. It seems to update approximately 3 hours after the transaction. It would be nice to have it be immediate. If they fix these two issues I’d say it would be a five star service. Another small gripe is that you can only get the no fee overdraft with direct deposit. Though if you budget correctly it’s not an issue. Just a small quality of life thing. Otherwise I’d say this bank does everything better than most other banks. 

*My previous rating was three stars but I realized that one of the issues wasn’t the banks fault but rather the third party company Green Dot’s. I don’t like having to pay such large fees just to deposit cash but it’s Green Dot policy.",Great bank but I’d like to see some improvements in the future.,

Even though there is no stand-alone bank, I have had an excellent experience with Chime. 1) I like getting paid early 2) No overdraft fees, love the Spotme feature 3) Ease of use 4) I love that I view my card in the app, it sounds lazy, but I’m tired of pulling out my card every time I want to buy something online (lol). 5) I love that my mom and I both got $50 when she referred me to sign up for an account. What an awesome referral program for everyone. 6) You can turn your debit card transactions on/off with the click of an app. (I forget to turn it back on sometimes! I’ve embarrassed myself at a store a time or two.)

Also, there are many ATM locations near me that are free of charge. I like that I can “round-up” to save if I’d like, or set 10% of my direct deposit aside. Chime has been compatible with PayPal and Apple Pay to send money to people. With that being said, I use cash at most restaurants / gas stations / stores, I don’t like my card number being out there. I had debit card fraud with my old bank account. I have not had that incident happen with chime and I hope that it never does.

It seemed like I was having a new issue every single week; the final straw for me was finding out my account was empty AND overdrawn, just over $50, for a “non-BMO ATM FEE”, literally with the ADDRESS of the BMO branch that was 2 blocks from the salon I worked at in downtown Chicago. Not to mention that they waited like TWO MONTHS LATER to try & charge me that fee...so I had to comb through all of my bank statements, and even after showing them the mistake was THEIRS, and THREE trips to the branch, it took another MONTH for them to fix it. Chime has literally changed MY LIFE. NO fees, thousands upon thousands of fee-free atm machines, excellent customer service...I can go on & on about how much I love this bank. Best of all is when I got their Credit Builder card, back in January....I’ve been working on my credit for about 2 years now, and as soon as I got the Chime Credit Builder Card, my score jumped up to 106 points on TransUnion and another 48 points on Equifax!!!

The only reason why I am going to open up a separate account with a brick and mortar is because in the next few years I want to get a decent home loan and usually being a member of the bank will help with that. Other than that this is perfect especially for people that aren’t ready to make a major purchase yet. I have had issues in the past and they have been resolved quickly and customer support is quick to ask. For those that are having issues with the chatbot, you can just type “human” and you can submit something to them and they usually get back to me within less than 12 hours probably about four. There have been times where the system has been down. This is why I’m removing a star. The system has been down several times in the past year by several I mean like maybe three but that’s still too many times. I have a credit card as back up. Working in IT myself I can’t actually be too upset. Things happen. I am prepared.

My FAVORITE feature about chime though is its statements. It, well pretty accurately categorizes your expenses and you can see what amount of money goes to what each month. This is huge. It really does bring some spending habits to the front and center. 
One thing that is heavily advertised is the ability to get your check credited two days early. I can attest to that, it happens every week for me.

My only suggestion is I wish it showed the ending balance as purchases are made on the statement.  I don’t like not being able to look back on purchases of deposits and not see what it brought my balance to at that time. I work at financial institutions and sometimes that’s what we require for proof of payment, so the fact that my bank doesn’t provided that is something that definitely sticks out for me; and in general it would help me keep track of my spending a lot better to know what I keep my balances at throughout the weeks. They seem good at looking at reviews, not sure if this is a concern for anyone else to make it a change but it would be nice if that be involved in a near future update.","Convenient, gets the job done.",

I put my baby down for a nap prepared for a long and annoying process that comes with any financial stuff. I literally downloaded the app, they asked maybe 3-4 questions, and not even 3 minutes later I had my checking account number and routing, and a temporary (picture of) my debit card that they said will arrive in a week. Then I see an option to open a savings account (which I’ve never even had) and 2 seconds later, boom, I have a savings account too. I don’t ever write reviews; I have about a hundred other things I could put my time too. But honestly I really felt like Chime deserved the time it takes for me to write this.

They use Plaid in order to connect the banks and on another app I got after signing up for chime I was able to connect just fine.

That tired out to be a waste of time, as Angel from Chime made it very apparent that he just copied and pasted his very generic responses from some guide Chime has, as not a single solution he suggested made any type of sense in terms of how it would help. I then emailed back to cancel my account, again of course to generic emails to indicate they have no intention of helping and I’m just out of luck, and have canceled my account without ever swiping it ONCE.

Wasn’t really looking for online banking, just wanted something I could put money on every once in a while. 

I decided to have my paycheck direct deposited. (Honestly because I wanted the black metal card I saw in my email). I shared it to my friends but didn’t get the card. 

However I ended up falling in love with the simplicity Chime has for its customers. Love that I can pay bills with a check for free without having to purchase a check book, I love Chime messages me everyday to let me know my balances, most of all i LOOVE getting paid 2 DAYS EARLY 😍😁 the modern way I bank because of Chime has me feeling some type of way 😉. 

Since my first direct deposit I have actually canceled my accounts at my other banks and now only use Chime. I love it being totally online but having the option to get cash if I really need it, without having to go into a dreaded bank and stand in a seemingly never ending line just to feel judged because the person at the counter can see I only have 23cents in my account. NOT ANYMORE!! I get paid before EVERYONE, I can add cash to my account at retail stores, it automatically puts money in my saving for all deposits and every time I use my car.

After having chime for almost 2 years I have to say I’m happy for the most part. Any time I want to make a cash deposit it costs me $5. Despite Chime saying they accept $1000 per day, the vendors that actually take the cash usually only accept $500 a day. I was given a large sum of cash from family and I had to spend a week depositing it and about $100 in fees for depositing it. Say I have $5000 in my account and I find a car I want to buy... it’s impossible since there’s a daily limit of $1000 at ATM’s, not to mention most ATM’s only let you take out $200 max per visit. Have fun paying your rent via money order. You’ll stand at the ATM for 10 minutes. The upside is that there’s no overdraft. Basically, if there’s not enough cash in the account it won’t even let the debit go through. I love getting paid two days earlier, but I always regret not having a physical location I can bank with.

You see they want to be a bank but they want to operate like a those alternative bank card accounts people get that have issues with banks and can’t obtain a real bank account! They need free standing ATMS that accept cash/check deposits and WITHDRAWALS! 3) The only way to GET CASH is cash back at stores. AGAIN making it beneficial for them to have free standing ATMS.

The 1st issue i ever had with them was at the end of September i recently started a new job what is the coincidence that the very day i get paid a very large paycheck somehow someone magically has my bank card number 2 states away and uses it at a gas station. Get that situation squared away and i was supposed to have been shipped a new card over a month ago never received it. Placed a new order for a card because i thought it may have been some confusion on my behalf due to moving. Now i have to wait 10 more days for something that has been going on for almost 2 months I’m not sure what issues they are having they need to look into some form of card less atm access prior to the recent issues I’ve had with them and then with the app going down i had nothing but rave reviews about them now I’m not so sure,Disappointed,

FALSE,customer testimonial,5,12/17/2020 18:31,"I’ve always thought it would be great if I were in a tough financial spot there would be a way to really punish myself.

I’ve banked with other banks before and overdraft ‘protection’ has always been a convenient way to add insult to financial injury, but it never quite went far enough.

Now with Wells Fargo, I can wake up to unlimited overdraft charges instead of just one!  It’s exactly the thing I was looking for.  Regardless of whether I fund the account before the account closed for the day (so no cheating on my part!).  I paid $280 in overdrafts this morning, and boy did I deserve it.

Wells Fargo has proven essential in my quest to convince myself never to go into business for myself again and I couldn’t be more grateful.  

Maybe in the future they could try a feature that makes a laughing sound when I open the account to see the overdrafts, or even just the middle finger emoji would be good?  Regardless, it’s great as it is.  

Thank you Wells Fargo!  It’s a very difficult time for small business owners like myself right now and I for one really appreciate the charitable works you are doing in taking steps to put us out of our misery as quickly as possible.

I just hope and pray that you are able to benefit from whatever stimulus package is passed 🤞

FALSE,OPTCGlobalSuks,3,4/27/2020 4:38,"As someone who joined to test the service.

1. You can never replace human customer service with a bot.

2. Transfers from other banks shouldn’t take 5 business days.  If you can zelle same day, you can transfer funds from other banks same day.

3.  Every bank and financial institution allows the user to use their preferred email. Just because it isn’t gmail or iCloud doesn’t make Chime special to Not allow use of a private email service of your choice.

4. If there was ever an issue with the account, and there needs to be an immediate remedy, a bot chat can not understand the importance of why something needs to be fixed or remedied immediately.

Now with that said, I would only use Chime for allowance spending and having funds 1-2 days early is nice.  If that’s the only thing of value and worth to you, than by all means whatever floats your boat.  

I’d give it a 3 star because I literally transferred the limit of $200 a day to go into the account and it was so slow.  Like I should’ve just zelled myself, or zelle to someone else who could zelle it to me the same day.  But 5-6 days... that’s holding my money hostage.  

And as a test, I transferred money to my other bank same day who was 3 days faster than Chime in processing.  So after these tests, sorry Chime, you’re not for me.

I hope one day there’s a branch location for services. It’s all digital including checks but it’s super straightforward and easy to use. I banked with Wells Fargo for 21 years and had to pay so many fees. With Chime the fees are to deposit cash into my spending account and fees to use ATM’s or banks outside of their selected locations. The fee at CVS is about $4.95-$5.00 for me to be able to deposit my cash into my spending account card. This is the only downer. I wish there was a self serve ATM where I could deposit cash onto my debit card. Chime has my back with accidental over spending called Spot Me. 
I have a credit builder card account, a “spending” aka debit card account and a savings account. I loveeee getting my paychecks in two days early. I use Chimes ATM map for free “in service” ATM’s.
I’ve gotten my IRS tax checks and my Stimulus Checks earlier than my friends while banking with Chime.

The limitations are:
I can only withdraw $500 per day at an ATM.
Depositing cash/ load cash onto my card has close to a $4 fee.
There isn’t a branch.

1st issue ...

For various reasons some online only banks cannot be used to signup or link accounts to various other services, like investment apps for example. I was able to link my Chime account to Acorns, however services like Robinhood, Stash, Coinbase and many others will not accept Chime's routing number. In fact, almost any service which utilizes Plaid APIs will reject Chime accounts.

I would say this is an issue with the other services but apparently not. This issue stems from certain mobile/online only banks and thier routing numbers, Chime being one of them. Most unfortunate.

This is a HUGE problem for anyone wanting to link their bank accounts with other online apps and services!!

2nd Issue ...

My wife's Chime card was debited fraudulently, with other banks the process of reimbursing funds is usually quick, not with Chime, so beware!

A new card was issued quickly, but it took many calls and actual paperwork, plus waiting time to get the funds returned.

1. I signed up and got everything set up. Debit card takes 3-4 weeks in the mail. Most online banks take 5-10 business days and in my experience it’s been 5-7 realistically. I’ve also read a lot of reviews where people waited over a month for their debit cards, that’s ridiculous.

2. I set up my external accounts and started transferring money into my chime, and had no issues. Unfortunately though I don’t have my debit card yet so I decided to transfer some money out to an external account and boom! I’m locked out of transferring money out of chime until my debit card is activated. It would be nice if they explained that somewhere but they don’t until you try to do it.

3. The biggest issue I have with chime! If you don’t use direct deposit, you can not use the mobile check feature. No where do they tell you this before opening the account. So if you’re someone whose job doesn’t offer direct deposit but gives a personal check chime will be no good for you. Wouldn’t be such a big issue for me if they explained that before opening the account.

Positives: Great Spot Me (Overdraft) feature. 

Round Up savings feature is good. 

They also have a feature where you can save 10% of your net pay.

You can connect your other accounts so you can transfer money easily. 

You can also find ATM’s in your area that allow you to withdraw money at no charge.

Negatives: Fraud Claims/Disputes take a long time to get resolved. Had to file a claim a few months back. Claim was approved but rep forgot to credit my account back. Had to call customer service several times to get credit. 

 A little while back Chime had a major outage where you could not access your account, view your balance etc. It also takes a long time to receive a new card.

Chime did make an effort to make it right by upping everyone’s Spot Me Limit and giving members $10 due to the inconvenience of the outage. 

Suggestions: I hope Chime has plans to overhaul their dispute process. It should not take 2 + weeks to have a claim reviewed and processed.

The marketing team. But .... I was already with a mobile banking service; and I switched to Chime for that one reason only.

Won’t let me do it. So what’s the point of Chime allowing me to link an outside account?!.

That’s when I found Chime, which remedied two of those issues. As an app, it’s awesome. The UI is great and is aesthetically pleasing (the emojis on the purchased are a nice touch)! And the fee less operation is really nice. 

My main beef with Chime, is that it’s merely a place to park cash; they don’t offer any enticing interest rates or anything of that nature. This is a nice app for monitoring finances, but not necessarily developing financial literacy and actually saving money. 

I’ve also been getting my direct deposit sent to Chime, and yet I still don’t have access to functions like mobile deposit, which are supposed to be unlocked after I set up direct deposit 🤔

I’ve turned to Ally instead, which offers a checking account with minimal fees and outrageously high interest rates, all packaged within what I would call well designed software and outstanding customer support.

I always have a hard time keeping up with my wallet and/or cards. Not because I lose it or them, but because I just misplace em. Shortly after misplacing my debit/credit card and needing my info in a troubling situation (out of gas and was trying to set up Apple Pay because I neglected to do so before that moment) I found chime and learned that it is, ABSOLUTELY, 100% accessible online. No need to worry about not being able to look up certain and specific info when you need it. I understand where company’s go by not giving out any info to you over the phone, about your own account, but something’s are just over the top and chime covers all of the bases. I haven’t gotten the chance to activate the ‘spot me’ feature as I’m waiting to set up DD, but for the month or so I’ve had it, it’s been beautiful. 

No hassles, Average ATM fees (unless used at a chime supported locations (like every card with every bank),) and support when you need it as requests do not take long to be answered no matter what time of day it is!

Unlike Netspend and the Walmart card I am ableist to use the cash app and use it for instant cart things you can’t dowith Netspend. Also the chime card has a chip. Not to mention the spot me is when you need a little help when you have overdraw your account  they do it with out deciding what they will cover and what they won’t. They start you at $20 and then you earn more. To make this happen they ask if you will make a tip to continue to help this to be an option. You can tip if you want but it’s not mandatory. This is the best Choice for me.,Best banking ever!,

Several months ago I made the changes to move my social security deposit to Chime. It’s awesome having my money available to me now as much as 6 days earlier than it was in Wells Fargo.

I have one suggestion that would make the app a bit better. Since you’re only allowed to have one savings account, incorporating an envelope-type budgeting tool into the savings account would allow you to separate what you’re saving for in envelopes and make it easier to set and meet goals.

There are no tellers, no bank managers, and no actual bank branches. It’s an e-account that provides checking, savings, and direct deposit. The app is INCREDIBLE. It does all that I need it to do. Some of my check is even automatically directed to my Chime Savings account so I can work on saving money without doing anything. 

I started using Chime because of the 2-day-before-your-normal-payday payday, right? But I keep Chime because of how user friendly the app is and what it does for me convenience wise. Back to the 2-day in advance payday though.. that seriously got me through some tight financial situations and now that I have a handle on things I can look back and see how I those 48 hours extra access to MY paycheck was (is) a life saver.

I still keep my conventional bank account for those few and far between transactions like wires, cashiers checks, and for automatic bill pay.

My only big gripe with Chime is in the way you deposit cash to your account. You must do this at a retail location supported by Chime and functions like you’re reloading a prepaid debit card. You cannot deposit cash thru ATMs, and there is a fee attached.

For a company claiming they’re all about getting rid of bank fees this is inconvenient and archaic. I will give Chime four stars as I do not carry cash often, but the ability to deposit cash into an ATM without fees should be a standard not a luxury.",Simplistic banking with a caveat.,

When I needed to withdraw a few thousand dollars for a private sale I quickly discovered that there was no fast way to get the money to one of my brick bank accounts.

Each of my other accounts use Zelle for quick money transfer. By quick I mean less than 15 minutes. If Chime had Zelle integration I could have quickly moved my money to a brick account and shown up with cash to buy the car.

Adding the accounts by providing all of a customers login credentials from a financial institution is a “NO GO”. I see we can deposit at Walgreens & CVS with fees attached. Loading cash to Chime with a linked debit card should be instantaneous like Cash App. The technology is here for the customers. I suggest Chime get onboard.

3) Direct deposit; I work at a job where I would typically get paid on Friday-even with direct deposit. I now get my pay deposited a day earlier which I love
4)The card is in my control; if I misplace my card I can shut it off with the switch of a button
5) I utilize account updates; my Chime acct messages me everyday to what my balance is. The moment my Chime card gets used, it alerts me and shows the merchant & amount left in my account instantly.

Also wish they’d allow you to save whatever percent of any deposit (not just direct despots over $500). The “save when you get paid” advertising is misleading. 

Customer service is hit or miss. Love the in app messaging but you don’t always get a human response. The bots are frustrating to deal with.

Now there’s no way to access my money and I’m sol for 2 weeks. GREAT. Then they lied said that could reactivate my card. NO. so no money for 2 weeks money is just sitting there.

Wow! I said, that’s double what I’m getting. Sign me up!

I sign up, and as I’m going through the process I see that their interest rate has been adjusted but that webpage apparently hadn’t been. It’s now down to 1%.

Ok, that still better then I’m getting. I sign up, transfer the max amount possible before I get the chime debit card ($10,000), and that transfer takes about 6 days. A little longer then what I was comfortable with, but whatever.

Two days later: new email from chime. “ As of December 9, 2020, the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for your Chime Savings Account will change from 1.00% to 0.50%, with an interest rate of 0.50%”!

FALSE,jordonjackson,5,10/16/2020 20:16,"Banks often nickel and dime every single service offered. From minimum deposits to maintenance fees and to the atrocious overdraft fees of around $30 per transaction. Then, to top it all off, all of those banks “offer” a wonderful interest rate of 0.01% on saving, all whilst using your money to make risky investments.

Chime changes this approach. Chime doesn’t nickel and dime. It doesn’t even charge one penny! Minimum deposit? Nope. Overdraft fee? No. Savings? Yep! What’s the APY? As of now, 1.00%. Not great, but better than 0.01%. A secure credit card to build credit? Oui ! Fee-less ATM use? Absolutely. Free international use? You got it!

The UI is very clean and satisfying and is generally easy to navigate.
It took quite a while to be able to properly link my bank account to PayPal, and using the Chime debit card requires a 1% fee, but that’s fine. I’m sure PayPal has their reasons. I think it’s because it’s somehow registered as a prepaid card on PayPal rather than a debit card. Interesting how that is.

Just wish I didn’t have to deposit cash through a person at the store. Again, social anxiety and autism. All that scares me a lot.  :’>  But the money’s gotta get in there somehow!","Heyyy, Das Pretty Guud",

Chime is what is needed moving forward but right now I feel like they are not able to offer me exactly what I’m looking for. 

It seems there are quite some issues linking Chime with other investment apps or even external banks. Investment apps like Wealthfront, Robbinhood and Coinbase - Other banks like Capital One.

It makes it more difficult to add money into those accounts because they don’t accept Chimes Routing Number yet.

There seems to be no issues if I was paying with Debit Cards but I’m looking at long term use and even though I believe strongly that Chime is the future for the millennial generation, I’ll keep an eye out for more improvements.",Concept Good but Features lacking,

Also, it takes about a week to transfer any amount of money to this account. Which I find weird since it’s directly linked to BOA.

And money orders, their system is only good if you get direct deposits and are cashless. 

I've had problems with Chime depositing checks from my mom, and trying to put cash into my account. So yes you can deposit $1000 day but you have to pay the store location fee twice to $3.72 at Walmart for $500 deposit of cash, or $4.95 for $500 deposit.  So depositing $1000 is $7.44 at Walmart or $9.90 at other locations. They don't tell you that you have to pay the fee twice to deposit that $1000.

I tried money orders, rejected, and my moms checks which they had deposited before but now have problems.  I'm canceling this account here in the next couple of months.

I hope that helps! Good luck!",Don't use if you get cash or deposit checks,
