I waited it out because I had no other choice, and thank goodness I did. Because this app literally fed me when I was going through serious hardship and they helped me pay off my overdue credit card on time by just allowing me to get the money already earned at work. Even through this Pandemic, they‚Äôre still operating and doing the best they can. This was my only issue: my bank is a credit union, so direct deposit hit a day early but always in the afternoon, so Earnin deducted the money I borrowed that morning as they should, making my account negative and incurring overdraft fees.  I thought this was part of the ‚Äúcatch‚Äù.  I contacted their support team late at night (I think around 11 or 12) because I commute 2 hours and a half to and from work (each way. Yeah, I was really going through it that year)  and told them Earnin pulled too early in the day. They asked me to screenshot the overdraft fees for a refund, which happened right then and there and allowed me to quickly get groceries before the train came.

All in all, if you‚Äôre really going through financial hardship, please trust on me that this is the perfect app. I‚Äôm writing This because I‚Äôm having one of those ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for this ‚Äú moments. Thanks for taking the time to read :)",This app literally saved me

I was really strapped for cash and my credit limit was maxed out when my car broke down, thankfully I was able to stumble across this app. It took 10-24 hours for them to verify and link the app to my bank account but as soon as I did I was able to cash out $100 within minutes it went straight to my account. If you are on the fence of opening another credit card try this app first. As of now there is no MANDATORY fee but optional tips that keep the app afloat and as with credit the better you tip and pay back your cash outs the better your cash outs can be. This pay period I got a boost to be able to front $200 from my next paycheck as opposed to the initial $100. One problem I‚Äôm seeing a lot of people have with this app is that it is like a credit card account in the fact that your payment takes up to two days to process so if you don‚Äôt have the money in the account it can definitely leave you overdrawn because it comes out of your account the day of or the day after your paycheck automatically. I have and will continue to recommend this app so long as privacy and fee policies don‚Äôt change too drastically in the future.

I kept getting a message that would say it‚Äôs taking longer than usual so try back. I‚Äôd wait a few days and try again but the same errors were given to me.

I went to my banks site and there wasn‚Äôt a message or alert or pop up. I called my bank and they said they aren‚Äôt blocking any third party access.

As long as you have proof of employment AND proof of online banking, Earnin allows you to borrow funds (up to $500, with a maximum withdrawal rate of $100 per day) against your next paycheck. Set your bi-weekly pay period in the app and Earnin will automatically debit the amount previously borrowed once it sees a direct deposit made from your employer. Note that it does take a couple of days for Earnin to authorize your bank account info so if you download this app today, there‚Äôs a good chance that you won‚Äôt be allowed to borrow any money for a few business days. It‚Äôs a tip based app so there‚Äôs no subscription fee each month. You tip what you believe is fair. I personally tip $1 for every $100 I borrow. And on average I borrow up to $400 each pay period. Earnin allows users to submit screenshots of their time cards as well as set up your employers location. Tracking your phones location is another way for Earnin to update your earned money for that day in case you forget to post your time card often. At first, users will only be allowed to borrow $100 - $200 as a pay period maximum but as you continue to use the app, that amount can and will increase that limit up to $500.

Let me start off by saying THANK YOU to the app developers, the ones who run Earnin and everyone involved in this process!! 
When I first downloaded Earnin, I was VERY skeptical to put in my banking information. I went on and took a chance when I got into a bind and I am so thankful I did! The app works by seeing your location and how many hours you are at your work address. I thought well, I can‚Äôt do that, I work in a different location EVERY day. It does connect to Tsheets and Brink, both of which my company does not use. They provide the option to upload timesheets! Once I screenshot my timesheet and upload it, my earnings are updated within 10 minutes! (I really appreciate YOU, the person who verifies these too!) I only use this in an emergency situation and it keeps people out of debt with check cashing companies which can really financially hurt anyone with the never ending cycle they get you into. Speaking of finance charges, YOU get to choose how much you want to ‚Äòtip‚Äô. I ALWAYS tip, even if I‚Äôm running low. This service is ALWAYS here when I need it, they need to be paid for the time, efforts, and just for the simple fact they provided me with a service. Sometimes I do tip more because I know there are the people who take advantage of it and don‚Äôt tip anything. PLEASE TIP!! Keep this service going and at a low cost for EVERYONE!!!

They ask me to send screenshots and then claim that the account info doesn‚Äôt match what they have on their records...the same info that I typed in 3 weeks ago, for a bank account I‚Äôve had for nearly 5 years. I then send more screenshots with carefully worded responses because there is clearly not a blanket solution to my issue. I the receive form responses or no response at all. I‚Äôve worked in customer service and currently work in sales, if handled my accounts with such a laissez-faire attitude I wouldn‚Äôt have a job.

UPDATE: about a week after my initial review, my problems were resolved. I have been using the app problem free for a couple months now and can say it is truly as good as it sounds. They give you the money, and it gets deducted when you get paid.

Then a few months later my limit starting going down by 50 each perriod and is back down at 250 despite me working more hours, getting a raise, a bonus, still following the suggested guidelines, and generally just earning more money. It seems that there is more that they take into consideration when setting limits that they don‚Äôt tell you. The service is nice when you need it but with so many other services offering the same thing, I might try one of the others to see if they are more transparent about what drives the decisions to set the limits. It seemed odd that I am now more financially healthy than I ever was in the past and my limit keeps getting cut. On the other hand I am more financially healthy so I actually do not need services like this one so much. So I guess the limit decreases don‚Äôt effect me if I don‚Äôt use the service.

I signed up for lightening speed, and it saved me a couple times when I was in line at the grocery store and realized my groceries added up to more than I thought (I was able to cash out while standing at the register, and then swipe my debit card). It saved me in other instances too, and I always had great interactions with customer service. Not to mention, choosing how much to tip (how much to pay for the privilege of borrowing the money) made me really appreciative and feel I could trust the company.

Recently I was looking for a savings account, and saw Earnin had this new feature called tip me. It has a limit of $2k, but provides the ability to divide your savings into multiple jars (Christmas, vacation, etc). On top of that, it assigns you tickets for a chance to win some cash for every $10 you save! The account does not provide you interest, but I feel that Earnin chooses to be ethical because they cap the combined savings at $2k. So once you reach a goal, or get near $2k, you can transfer the money to another savings account that pays interest.

I love the idea of this app and it definitely came in handy the first and only time I was able to successfully use the app.  However, despite Earnin withdrawing my money out of my bank account to pay back my cash out, I am now unable to cash out anymore money because they can't connect to my bank account.  They have my correct banking information, they were able to deposit and withdraw money from my bank account, provided them with screen captures of my bank statement showing my recent paycheck deposit as well as Earnin withdrawal as both the app and their support department requested, but they still can't connect to my bank account saying that it's an issue with their provider that they use to connect to back accounts.  This makes no sense whatsoever.  Support told me that this is an issue other people that use my same credit union, but obviously they can connect to my bank account because my bank statements show that and there were no connection issues last week when I cashed out and they accessed my account to pay back my cash out.  I was then asked if I have another bank account I could connect to.  No, I do not nor does that some this issue.

Update: Earnin did refund my overdraft fees and fix my withdrawal date. Giving 4 stars for lack of the hassle of going through this mess.

I don‚Äôt like how there‚Äôs not a feature we can use to add our overtime pay as well as any sick, personal or vacation days we use!  The app counts it as $$ not earned that day when in fact most of use have work benefits that cover any time taken!  Also, why is the max payout only $100 per pay period, which I make way more than that in a single day of work!!??  It was my understanding that I would be able to pull out $$ as long as I‚Äôve already earned it at work...so that‚Äôs very misleading!!  A lot of people had said that this app was better than applying for and getting one of those payday loans...well it‚Äôs not if the app only allows you to take $100 every 2 weeks, which is how I get paid!

There are no hidden fees. They tell you what your limit is. Your phone's location tracks how long you are at your job and it's calculated how much you've made that day.

I built up over $1,200 in available money to be pulled, etc. The only thing I didn‚Äôt do: tip the ‚Äúsuggested‚Äù amount every time I pulled money out. They say that they can lower your available amount if you aren‚Äôt tipping what they deem is ‚Äúfair‚Äù.  It automatically will suggest you to tip $9 if you pull out $100.

Earnin has helped me immensely with gaining my financial independence back amidst the pandemic. I am no longer living paycheck to paycheck. Instead I can do whatever I need to do, whenever I need to do it. I like that you can set your work location because then Earnin also shows me how much I have earned for that day and when I cash out it subtracts it from that amount (ex $500 earned this week, cash out $100 today, updates to show $400 earned this week). The fact that it‚Äôs funded by the people, for the people and that you can send each other cute little thank yous is awesome too.

The only things that kind of get on my nerves is that it forces you to tip (you can choose how much but your limit will go down if you don‚Äôt tip at all). Also, your maximum withdrawal limit can change every pay period depending on how you‚Äôve used the app. So for example I started with $100 but then they bumped me up to $200.

If that's the case, you are essentially borrowing from your own next paycheck and leaving a tip of your choosing for the privilege.

Naturally, you shouldn't overly rely on this service or your pay will come and you'll have no pay and be right back into the boat of having to borrow again.

It‚Äôs personal banking info plus it‚Äôs ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù free. I needed a way to help me out between pay days, so I was willing to try it. It literally changed my whole perspective. This app literally just wants to help you out, and that is amazing to me. The pay it forward system they have is fantastic too. They advertise the app as made by the people for the people, and I truly believe that. This app is helps take away some of the stress from living pay check to pay check. You do not get paid for 5 days yet you have a bill due before then. This app has got your back by literally giving you some of the money you already earned at work. When you get paid the amount you took is simply deducted. No fees. It has truly been a blessing in my life. I highly recommend it. The initial start up is a tad cumbersome but simply because your employment and banking information need to be verified. After that it‚Äôs smooth sailing!",Simply Fantastic

Second, every other payment to them isn't recognized by the app so when you go to borrow money sometimes it'll still say you haven't paid and then you have to screen shot your bank records and message a representative about it.  That and the app itself never accurately shows your bank balance on its dashboard. You could get paid and they take the money and yet it'll still show some random amount that's far lower, so it makes me think that their metric isn't getting the proper information either if that's how weak the app operates.

UPDATE:

This is still the best app to use if you are strapped for cash, however, I am running into a problem where I am on PAID PTO, yet, I cannot access any cash since I am not physically going to work. 

I have sent screenshots of my timesheet, however, they also ask for proof of pay while out of the office. I cannot send that since I don‚Äôt get paid for another 2 weeks.

But spending $90 a month just to have access to my money is crazy. Again do the math. Let‚Äôs just suppose Earnin has 500,000 users who each tip 9 per transaction. Even if each user just does 1 transaction: 500,000 X $9 tip = $4.5 million dollars. Crazy amount just to run an app service.",Limit is based on how much you tip

,Miss Sarahlee,FALSE,3/31/2018 16:37,5,"I was skeptical at first, like many people, but I've been using this app for several months now and I've always been extremely happy with it. Ironically, it has helped me put money into savings -- when I know less bills are going to be coming out of a certain paycheck, I advance more money and dump it right into savings. Once it's in savings, I only use it in an emergency. However, if I had just gotten the money in my paycheck like normal, I wouldn't be as likely to move it to savings, but rather, I would probably spend it. But, the app is great for when an unexpected bill comes up. If you need more than the $500 pay period max (which you have to build up to earning; you start at a $100 pay period max) you should either look into getting a different job or a second job, or learn ways to better manage your money. I definitely recommend the app!","Legit, helpful app when you need a little extra money to hold you over"

It seems they've even taken it a step further and improved even more, as I took a several month hiatus from work due to school and didn't have to do anything once I was working again to use my Earnin account. 

As others have said, I prefer borrowing money from myself, and this app makes it really easy to do so. It gives me such peace of mind that I have access to my future paychecks should I need them, especially because I'm a student and unexpected issues come up all the time. It blows my mind that it's a free service, so I try to tip when I can. 

My only *minor* critique is that I used to get my money instantly when I used the Lightning Speed perk, but now it takes about a day to process. It just requires me to think in advance a bit more, but it'd be nice if it was able to be instant again!

*EDIT* I was helped by two very very nice employees, Donna and Beepsie, who informed me why the Lightning Speed wasn't working! now i get my money instantly, and i have even more good things to say about earnin. üòä",Amazingly implemented concept!

It‚Äôs a perfect solution to a super temporary problem!!! I originally tried this app because I was moving and the holidays were approaching and I just wanted a cushion for emergencies. I personally get paid bi-weekly, and around the 11th day or so, it‚Äôs tight. Especially since I moved into my own place by myself for the first time. No roommates to pick up the slack those last few days before payday.  
So far this app has served its purpose and then some!!! Ive saved so much money just by avoiding the overdraft fees, and shady cash loan places.  The ‚Äútip‚Äù thing is a no brainer. I‚Äôd MUCH rather pay $5 to this app for $60 of *my own money* rather than $45 worth of fees for some bank/check cash place who could care less.

When they finally responded they didn‚Äôt acknowledge anything that I mentioned about me letting them know before they tried to bill me that I did not get paid until after the holiday. They then mentioned that on my profile it states that I get paid before the holidays(they set that not me).

I started off by only being able to borrow $50 when I first started. I‚Äôm now able to borrow $400 from my pay check every two weeks, with max cash out of $100/day!! The best part is, you‚Äôre not charged interest!!! That‚Äôs right!! You‚Äôre not charged interest!! All you do is tip (like you would at a restaurant or a bar) and that‚Äôs it!! The tips help keep the app running along with spotting others by paying it forward to someone who may not be able to tip (hint: since we are all borrowing money from our check, some may not being able to tip). There is no minimum tip and you are not forced to tip. Whatever you borrow will be deducted from your bank account when you get paid!! It‚Äôs that easy and then you‚Äôre able to borrow from EarnIt once it‚Äôs deducted from your account. 

Also, I have my debit card connected to the EarnIt app and when I cash out from the app to get some extra cash, it comes at you ‚Äúlightning speed‚Äù which means it shows up right away in your account. No, waiting till the next day etc!! Like I said, I could go on and on about how great this is!!

If it doesn‚Äôt work consistently then it defeats the whole purpose of the app. 

Long review:  I‚Äôve had this app for over a year and it worked great and has slowly gone from great to okay to awful. The last week I‚Äôve had nothing but technical issues. First my account wouldn‚Äôt link to my bank account out no where. Nothing regarding my bank account was changed. I worked with an agent to have it fixed. Two days later my debit card was unlinked. I spent 40 minutes with an agent getting it fixed. Three days later after my card was verified it‚Äôs not working again and saying it‚Äôs being verified - even though I just worked with an agent to have that fixed. Working with agents is frustrating. They don‚Äôt explain the issue and just copy/paste. According to the most recent agent this is only an issue an engineer can fix and have no idea when it will be fixed. There‚Äôs no point in using the app if it‚Äôs not consistent.","Used to be great, now technical issues galore!!"

Out of the blue last week the app brought up a screen stating that my bank account was not connected. When I tried re enter my bank information it gives me an error message and asks me to try another bank account. I have tried several times to reach out to customer service but am being sent in circles. I have tried to send screen shots of the error message I am getting and still have not been helped. I tried reaching out to my bank(Credit Union) to make sure there were no blocks on it but they have no issues on their end. It‚Äôs just strange that they were able to deduct the funds from my account from the previous time I borrowed the day things started messing up I would love to continue using this app if I‚Äôm able to but if not..I guess it was fun while it lasted.,Running in Circles can‚Äôt seem to get my issue resolved

My dog got super sick during quarantine and we had to take her to the emergency vet. After 12 hours of waiting, we found out that she had an infection in her mouth and it was gonna cost a LOT to fix it. It was 3 days to pay day and I needed to put money down before they‚Äôd take her into surgery. 
Earnin got me cash - fast! - so I could get my dog into surgery without using CareCredit (the worst scam of all time ü§¨), then I was able to pay off the last of the bill on my pay day.

This app has taken the stress and fear from the loss of my job, to being confident that everything will be just fine. Although I don‚Äôt know that was the intended use of this app is has legit saved my family during this tough time. If you use it responsibly and make sure you pay back on time etc you will LOVE this app. Thanks for existing Earnin",Amazing!!!

I‚Äôve had this app since holidays 2018. It started as extra help for gifts and I ended up loving it.
However, earnin has slowly become more and more greedy. How do I mean? Well let‚Äôs start with before $5 would cover my tip and someone else‚Äôs, now I have to tip upwards of $10 to do so. Developers, don‚Äôt even bother saying it‚Äôs because your platform is larger so that‚Äôs the only way to do it, because if your platform is larger than a smaller tip should cover multiple people by default.
The next aggravating thing is that I‚Äôm salaried, I have been for years. My paycheck has actually gotten bigger this past year, and yet my maximum has been cut in half. My balance is positive. And I always have enough to pay earnin back. 
Their reasoning? Go to work more and pay us more. Uh, I already work 45 hours and I have loads of vacation time. So although I‚Äôm not always at the same job site, trust me, my pay doesn‚Äôt change.

Get a grip people, when you borrow $100 now, guess what you don‚Äôt have in your paycheck???? Take a wild guess.... $100 dollars. That‚Äôs $200 a month you‚Äôre losing from your check! Ridiculous! 

If you invest half of that in the stock market as good growth stock mutual funds, you‚Äôll have almost $200,000 after 30 years!!!! That‚Äôs 25% of the way to millionaire status people, come on! Put the full $200 in and you‚Äôll have close to $400,000.

The fact that this app is so frictionless and takes seconds to send people into bi weekly cash advances is one of the scariest things ever. If you‚Äôre dumb enough to fall for something like this stupidity then this app is perfect for you!

But I have zero complaints. It‚Äôs much better than getting a 500% interest payday loan. You chose what to tip and that‚Äôs it. I have used several times for fuel to work or for a couple extra bucks before payday hits. It‚Äôs like borrowing some money from your friend and paying it back (plus whatever you chose to tip) on payday. Great for people that need a hand every once in a while.,Awesome app

I typically keep my tips to between at least $5 to $9 and sometimes that ends up paying for my cash out and at least one other person‚Äôs. I hope this app is around for good because I LOVE IT.

I have been using it for a few months, but ran into and issue about 3-4 weeks ago. They stopped updating my balance. 

This was blamed on my bank, and yeah, maybe it is their fault, but once you start borrowing money, you have to ebb yourself off. Since my bank balance stopped updating, I couldn‚Äôt borrow money, and ended up down by about $300. 

The resolution was to send a screenshot of the money I was about to borrow on payday, my pay deposit, and my balance. This resolved the issue until I was paid last Friday. Then I had to deal with it again. This time support was insistent that I send a screenshot of my pay deposit with the last 4 of my acct number in the same photo. Not exactly an easy feat, but I managed. 

I was finally tired of it, so I started looking into options, and I was ready to remove and re-add my bank info, when I saw an option. To update my banking info. After maybe 20-30 minutes of dealing with that and waiting, my balance is finally updated in the app.

It‚Äôs an awesome system, tip what you can (which is important to the app being free, so please tip if you‚Äôre using!!) or nothing at all and you see that in your bank account immediately.

Anything you‚Äôve cashed out for that period comes off your next check, which I love because I‚Äôm not worried about getting behind on my payments, worrying about accruing interest, or any other hassle typical with a payday type loan or credit card. 

There is no trickery to the app, it runs so smooth with no crashing issues, ads, or anything else to make you feel unsafe entering sensitive info into earnin.

Plus it really does incentives putting good hours in at work with the earning tracker, it can make days at work that seem so so long much shorter when you go on your lunch break and see that you‚Äôve already earned 70 bucks or so.

I think it‚Äôs perfect for those in a pinch and/or new to the financial world. 

The one setback I‚Äôd say is that if you cannot enter your timesheet through one of their approved times tracking system you‚Äôre short. Their automagic tracking system isn‚Äôt necessarily the most accurate as it depends on signal/location strength and phone settings. In the case of people whom work from home or work at multiple locations this is not ideal. 

As an absolute backup, earnin allows you to screenshot your timesheet and post it to update your earnings. However, when I use this option the app and support staff frequently deny my timesheet despite it following the stipulations for the timesheet and my loyal and consistent service.

For instance, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre paid $250 every week and you cash out the maximum amount that the app allows you to (let‚Äôs say $100). The very first time you do it, it may seem good.

Somehow my account holiday pay date was changed to the day before instead of the day after which it has always been without my knowledge and ended up with my bank being debited on a Saturday instead of the following Tuesday like it was supposed to resulting in overdraft fees and a very negative bank account. Contacted customer support and was basically told that it was my banks fault for processing the request early when this never would have happened if one of Earnin‚Äôs employees hadn‚Äôt changed the holiday pay date! All that was offered was to pay the overdraft fees instead of giving me my money back and taking it on the correct day.

All in all it has really helped quite a bit. I definitely recommend it to anyone who just needs that few extra bucks to get them through til their next paycheck.

Hopefully the issue is resolved.

This app has helped prevent overdrafts and helped when I'm in tight spots. The best part is it is a""pay what you think is fair"" style service, so when you're really tight you can scale back a little and when you just need a little bit until that fat paycheck clears, you can pay it forward.

Con: If you happened to overdraft over $100 the app won't let you use it's service until it clears the $-100 dollar mark. Ideally it would allow you to use it to help get to a positive balance if your max is over 100.

"{'id': 9963427, 'body': 'We strive to ensure every customer is satisfied with our business, and we truly apologize for any way in which we may have inconvenienced you. Please be advised that we have Maxes to ensure that we don\'t overdraft your bank account when we take money out on payday. Plus, tipping is not an obligation and Max limit shouldn\'t be affected if you cash out with or without tip. We consider many factors when increasing or decreasing your Max. The highest Max we currently offer is $500, and most customers will see the Max increase over time. Not to worry, we do a reevaluation of your Max on every payday since your Max limit is actually temporary and can decrease or increase from time to time. You can try logging into the app and check on your next payday to see if you are eligible to have a higher max. Moreover, we have an entire section in our Help Center about how Maxes work. For your reference, you can check it out here: https://help.earnin.com/hc/en-us/sections/205419567-Maxes.

They get you in a bind where you are constantly borrowing and paying back. What makes it worse is that they will increase your max that you can borrow and then, even though you are paying them back every time, they will decrease it just because you have a low bank balance. So when you have borrowed $300 for example, you pay them back and depend on being able to borrow back that same amount and they will decrease your account to $200. So that extra $100 that you depended on is no longer available to you. Also, if you don‚Äôt tip at least what they suggest, they will decrease your max even more.

- when I changed jobs and my schedule went from biweekly to monthly I had some overdrawn charges, I worked with earnin to reverse that and get my account in good standing promptly, thank you!

Cons:
- only con i experienced is that when I went from biweekly to monthly my monthly ‚Äúborrow‚Äù amount was cut in half, this is because a pay period is treated the same no matter the duration. I‚Äôd suggest that users that get paid monthly have double the maximum, this would give me the same amount of flexibility I had before at my last job. It also gives me an opportunity to tip more.

This app was amazing but then it started to get weird with me. 
     Limiting my use from 500$ to 300$ to 100$ then randomly giving me the ability to get 500$ again a month later was very strange. 

Now the worst thing is happening. The app is not connecting properly at work so it thinks I‚Äôm only at work for an hour.

Your weekly limit won‚Äôt ever increase...so don‚Äôt tip. I have used it since September and I was tipping $15 per transaction until today. I didn‚Äôt tip at all...My weekly limit is $100, my bank account isn‚Äôt negative, I‚Äôve referred co-workers that use it, and I use it every paycheck..I‚Äôve done everything they‚Äôve asked and still my limit hasn‚Äôt (and probably won‚Äôt) increase.
Also, I have to send a screenshot of my bank account every week...but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs my banks fault or the apps fault so I can‚Äôt put that on Earnin.",Legen...wait for it...dary!

Things that I like about this app:
- simple, easy, straight to the point
- multiple ways to confirm and validate your account info
- no fees
- customer service chat
- no credit check

Thinks that I do not like about this app:
- no customer service phone number
- they change you max pay period withdraw limit for no real reason.
- decisions are automated by a computer criteria
- even though they say ‚Äútipping‚Äù is optional, if you don‚Äôt tip one time your max is lowered.

This is the best lending app in my opinion. But I would suggest adding a little more personal value to decisions. There is no reason that someone who pays their debt every pay day should lose their max level.

I use it way too much for my own good. 

I like the fact they take their money the day I get paid, I needed the money then, I usually need it before they take it, but that leaves me with no responsibility of having to add another bill on top of another since they take it right away. Not that I can‚Äôt afford it, but we borrow for a reason right. 

Since I get paid every week on a Thursday sometimes my bill is due and I don‚Äôt get paid in time. So I‚Äôll borrow that money and when they take it it‚Äôs the same difference. 

Since I do security work, im constantly moving around. Lucky I could put in my job information and just upload a screenshot of a timesheet. Thank you that. 

I‚Äôve yet to have a bad experience and I‚Äôve been using it for about a year. Waited a year to write this lol. 

Thank you Earnin.",It‚Äôs Legit Legit
