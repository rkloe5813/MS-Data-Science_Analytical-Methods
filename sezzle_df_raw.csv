FALSE,2/8/2021 10:39,One Word for This App.......AMAZING!!!!,5,Sandy 4 Brothers,"Sezzle has given me the chance to be able to shop as if I were a “ Platinum “ credit card holder. My credit is less then desirable in this credit crazed world we live in. Nowadays, if you don’t have a wallet full of plastic, you better have a wallet full of cabbage (cash😊)and I know I sure don’t have either on a day to day basis but I have the closest thing to it.....and that’s S-E-Z-Z-L-E...!!!!! I have 8 kids that I have raised and now with all but my youngest child being grown up and four having family’s, I now have 12 Grandchildren ( Yes 12 🥰) and my youngest only 11 yrs old, well that equals lots of groceries, bills, clothes, shoes, coats, etc... Oh and let’s not forget the presents for birthdays, and Christmas, oh my!!! All I know is if it weren’t for Sezzle, I wouldn’t be the favorite Mimi and not only can I buy things I wouldn’t otherwise be able to, but I’ve been able to purchase things in an emergency with stores that accept SEZZLE, like Autozone for brakes..Twice now!!! THANK YOU SEZZLE!! AS  if being AMAZING just for their program wasn’t enough, now they’re going to report to the credit bureaus which will help build my credit!! And all my payments are on time so I’m excited for this new step 😊",
FALSE,12/18/2020 1:51,Sezzle Review,5,RenCarDuB,"Excellent App, I have very much enjoyed having and using Sezzle!!! As well with the added credit line this has made Sezzle 100% BETTER than before!!! The only couple things I would suggest to make Sezzle the over all number 1 app across the board would be just a few minor things which would in my mind take Sezzle to the very TOP!!! 1. Easier to reach Customer Service ( I was charged all 4 payments for an order that I never even received) I placed an order with a company Caravan comfort which turned out they didn’t have the product so Caravan Comfort refunded back to me the cost of the product however Sezzle continued to charge me all 4 installments for the product I never received. I tried to reach a customer service rep from Sezzle and unfortunately was never able to do so there paid for a product I never received. I was extremely disappointed and hesitated in placing another order.
2. Allowing the Sezzle Credit line to be attached to Apple wallet and available to use for any purchases on any items any place or perhaps anyplace over the cost of $50-$100",
TRUE,6/5/2020 22:20,Caution!!! Sezzle seems shady👎,1,NostalgiaLadie,"3. As I said, contacting customer service doesn’t help at all. I can’t converse with anyone personally. My needs were not addressed at all. I tried and now I’m done with Sezzle. I will be paying close attention to the info that I provided to Sezzle (in case any fraud turns up). I terminated the Sezzle account. There was nothing else that I could do. If you won’t even converse in any way with your customers, you don’t care at all.

2. Sezzle is scary. I just attempted to call Customer Service and wasn’t allowed to speak to a live person, but was directed to their email form service. Immediately I was emailed an auto response, with the same sorry excuses of why no one can help solve this. Unbelieveable! I deleted my financial info and hopefully can terminate my Sezzle account. I regret trusting Sezzle to handle my financial and indentifying info. I’m glad I didn’t give them my main finacial info. smh

1. Declined for a $3 purchase? Really? This is rediculous! I recently was approved for Sezzle, but haven’t been permitted to make any purchases. I’m not being given any helpful reasons to why I’m being declined other than the purchase maybe too much. I have way more than enough to cover $3! Why was I approved for a Sezzle acct, if they won’t allow me to purchase through them? The purchase process is not user friendly either. Too many security codes required just to have the purchase declined. smh...There is no point to this...","{'id': 15807123, 'body': 'I understand your concern with your account.

FALSE,5/27/2021 0:27,Best Pay Later App On The Market,5,Gracies Eunni,"I have used Sezzle for over a year and have made several large (over $1000 purchases). I have absolutely NO complaints! I tell everyone I know that Sezzle is the way to go if you need to make a fast purchase but would rather not pay the full amount up front. As you make in time payments your available balance will go up. 
  There are no interest, no fees (unless your late), no hidden charges (it’s the EXACT same price if you weee to pay by cash or debit card), and you can easily reschedule your payments on the app. You don’t need to speak to a rep or feel uncomfortable or embarrassed, you can handle everything yourself on the app- returns, payments, rescheduling, etc. 
  There are a lot of stores that accept it (more than the online list) and more were added over the past year but my only wish would be for even more stores/businesses to accept it. 
  No shame!, especially in these crazy times, it’s nice to be able to make 4 payments for a vacation/cruise, furniture, hair :) or when something unexpected pops up.",
FALSE,2/21/2021 3:16,Great way to get things,5,Freemee! 88,Hello everyone I just wanted to share with y’all that this app is just great! Sometimes we don’t have the entire amount for things so we just end up not getting them. That sometimes results on missing out on some great sales and it stinks. With this app it’s helped me get stuff I need without out breaking my wallet. It’s a great way to get what you want with 4 easy payments. I love it. I have my own business and sometimes I need stuff for my shop (A little bow shop) when I’m in need of some supplies I’m able to get on here and make that purchase it’s great. But also you have to be responsible you cannot just get stuff and not pay. You have to make sure you are able to make the payments. It’s every 2 weeks. So if you get paid on the 1st or 15th make your purchase where it won’t be an issue. I usually pay it off on the 3rd payment to be done with it. If you don’t have the money that week you can always move your date about 7 days out. So just work around your payday.,
FALSE,12/27/2020 0:53,Absolutely Legit,5,lisaLashay,"I’m so grateful for the Sezzle pay option. It has allowed me to treat myself recently, during a time where I haven’t been able to really do anything beyond pay bills because money is too tight to make large purchases. I also was able to get my son a very nice electronic item that he would not have been able to get if I had to pay full price up front. This card/acct is soooooo easy to use. All I did was pass my phone by the card reader machine at the store...via Apple Pay and boom purchase complete and I make my 4 small payments over the next 8 weeks. I definitely would recommend this to anyone. Not to mention All of the small businesses you get to support and help keep afloat during this crazy pandemic by shopping with them thru the app. So many stores to shop with that have awesome quality items made by hard working people. Now that I’ve paid my first purchase off early I’m most excited that Sezzle gives me the option to have them report positively to my credit. Great pay option !",
FALSE,6/11/2020 10:39,Excellent payment option by far,5,Mmmgayyboii<3,"I love how easy and transparent the whole process is. The payments are reasonable and there is no charge if you need to reschedule an upcoming payment for whatever reason. I love how after paying my payments on the day that it’s due my credit limit increases. You don’t have to have good credit to even get approved, actually you don’t even need your credit at all which is really awesome. They have a plethora of different stores that have partnered with Sezzle so you just browse through the stores and if you find something you love no matter what the price is all you do is chose Sezzle at check out and your 4 payments are laid out very clear and simple and the item is shipped right then and there instead of having to wait to get your item after all the payments are paid. I recommend this option to those who have a love of shopping like I do. You save your money longer then just spending it all at one time it’s amazing.",

FALSE,2/10/2021 14:27,Great.,5,indiana jomes,My only issue is that I have made a purchase in the amount of $125 with a company called Klase. This company states that they will issue a refund if needed and provide a return label. I did not order a custom piece however the items do not fit my daughters neck they are too large she’s a teenager therefore I’m returning the pieces. They also send another email asking for pictures of the items they sent to me. They also state that you can return the items and they will provide a return label. They have been difficult and every email is less helpful and final than the first.  I have stated that it’s a return and they ask again if it’s a replacement and send me photos of options. This company is extremely difficult to deal with and I will not make another purchase with them also they will not provide a return label and they are charging me a 15% restock fee. I am forever a sizzle customer but I will no longer patronize Klase.,

Since covid money has been a little low and even though I needed things I didn’t have the money and Sezzle made it happen. Without worrying about my credit and extra fees I have been able to buy the things I need. 
As far as business, it works wonders, my customers can buy from me and pay later and for them it’s good because they still get what they ordered and it’s great for me because even though they haven’t paid the full amount yet I still get paid in full from Sezzle. I haven’t had any issues and I just got an approval to a higher spending limit so this is going to be great for my business needs. Thank you!!",
FALSE,12/29/2020 23:29,Making my purchases more manageable and rewarded for using the app,5,Griff81818,This is the smoothest and most reliable buy now pay later app I’ve ever used. The customer service is excellent and your ability to boost your credit by making your four payments is a no brainer. I will be setting my wife up on the app and I’ve already spoken about it to family and friends. Anything you are looking to purchase can pretty much be found on the 20k plus stores Sezzle partners with. I find myself browsing the stores on the app for long periods of time and I can now purchase some things I want or need and don’t have to have the full payment up front but have the ability to pay more early if I can. Nothing but good things to say and nothing but praise for Sezzle.,
FALSE,10/5/2020 4:36,Lifeline,5,sethkj1212,"I am a big fan of paying all out front and not owing. However I’m also a big fan of credit cards. Sezzle allows me to combine the positives. I have set due dates for the payments that you can reschedule, and I use my credit card to pay, so it’s all split up and I can go longer without payments and less interest because the full purchase is not all on one credit monthly billing. I continue to be responsible of course, but Sezzle gives you that extra breathing room for keeping your budget straight if used correctly. I’ve heard of others having problems with being approved, I have not. Not that I don’t believe them, I’m sure they are telling the truth, but I haven’t myself, which I am thankful for.

I have gone back and forth with Venmo and Sezzle with every single payment and nothing has been taken care of on Sezzle’s end. 

It is nothing on Venmo’s end as I have plenty of funds with every payment and they’re not declining or blocking payments that are due to Sezzle. Venmo and I have spoken about every transaction and they know that none of the payments are fraudulent. They have also made it known that I don’t have pending charges that would hinder Sezzle taking their payment. 

I can change the payment method between two cards and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. 

Each and every time that I contact Sezzle, I either get the generic response or no response at all. I keep all emails and can prove the no responses. It just makes no sense to contact customer support if they can’t fix what’s wrong, like ever or just flat out don’t respond. 

While I love the convenience of Sezzle and the payment plans (which comes in handy) I am thoroughly disappointed in the payment system and customer service.

Regular credit cards are too dangerous for me since you can use them anywhere and on anything. I like that I’m actually limited to where I can use this card, and that it splits the individual purchase into four payments instead of rolling all purchases into one total which for me holds me way more accountable with my spending.

I can see how some of those things might cause someone to not want to use Sezzle but if that’s the case there are plenty of other cards that work like a traditional credit card. I needed something different that would help rebuild my credit score. Sezzle Up has been perfect for me.",

The 1st re-scheduling is free, the 2nd and 3rd cost a minimal $5.00 each!

FALSE,11/12/2020 21:16,10-Oct,5,Strawberry cute,"This app is great to spread out payments for whatever reason you need that.

I use it because I have to buy expensive textbooks but only get paid biweekly so spreading out the payments prevents me from having to borrow money from others. The app works really smoothly and it’s easy to use. A couple of my friends stumbled on this company and shared it to me bc they know I love supporting American companies(afterpay is Australian). 

So glad I was exposed to this service before it gets really popular! Haha it’s like I’m in on a ~secret~ anyways, I recommend to anyone who considers themselves high-tech and innovative! Already rlly popular among other ppl at my college. #callherdaddy >> #callhersezzle",

It’s also amazing that through the app or site you can literally shop and see all the stores they are partnering with! So you don’t just have to hope this cool new store has Sezzle, because it does.

By then I was about to make my 3rd payment to Sezzle.  I informed Sezzle of my issue and stated I wanted the money that I’ve paid this far.  Sezzle tells me to contact the manufacturer.  I’d already done that and they knew it.  Sezzle stated they could not give me a refund and that only the manufacturer could.  My issue is that Sezzle does not hild their manufacturers accountable.  I also don’t think Sezzle check the validity of these companies.  I should not have been paying for a product that I’d haven’t received so much as a tracking number for.
