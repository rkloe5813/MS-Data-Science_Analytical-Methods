"I love that Afterpay gave me a chance to shop and buy items that I’d been wanting to purchase, Without having to go through an extensive credit approval process and high interest rates!  I can pay off my purchase at any time or pay it out in installments.  It’s easy to use, and so is the approval process!  The only thing I don’t like, is the payment schedule.  I stayed that I get pd every other Friday.  That’s when my payments are due.  If you are on automatic payments, they may try to draft them before you can get your check in the bank, or before your check hits your acct., then that goes against you.  That’s not right! The due date is that day, right? Why does it matter what time I make the payment, as long as it is made that day?  Also, if you have more than one order, it may not correspond with your pay day?! The payment for all orders should definitely be charged on your payday.  You shouldn’t have to change your due date or get a message from Afterpay saying oops! Your payment couldn’t be processed, because you didn’t have sufficient funds, just bc you haven’t received your check yet, or haven’t had a chance to deposit it.  Not everyone gets their checks right after midnight on their payday.  This has happened to me, although I have made my payments, it’s gone against me, bc they tried taking it before my check hit.  That’s not right.  Otherwise, I love Afterpay!",5,FALSE,Afterpay is the better than credit!,jakb3,3/13/2021 16:09,
"Very much love the flexibility, convenience and how easy this app works! With so much going on with the pandemic, this app provides stress free shopping. Knowing you have to put down a quarter of your total gives you the liberty of shopping. Of course everyone has to keep in mind what they can afford as a payment every other week. If you buy any day of the week, expect your payment to fall that same day every other week. I usually purchase on pay day or weekend to make sure I have the funds available for payment. Afterpay provides days in advance reminders so you wont forget your payment is coming up even though the payments go through automatically. Such a stress free system! I had ordered from a store that i never received the package. I contacted the vendor and they notified afterpay immediately and they refunded the amount I initially paid as a down payment. I also had an order i returned due to wrong items, and the vendor automatically let afterpay know once they received the products to credit me back or remove the existing balance left. I really love the app and currently expecting my first child!! So i will definitely be making purchases. To know i don't have to pay it all at once is definitely a life savor! Thank you creators!!!",5,FALSE,Love!,Eileen_Noemi,3/7/2021 20:37,
"Easy to use interface, helps locate a variety of stores big & small businesses and offers certain discounts regularly for use when buying from one of their participants. Payments are spread out over a 4 payment schedule. As each payment is gets close to being due they send reminders to you of the actual due date as well as the price for that installment. You can pay it off completely with no additional charges or pay more than one payment at a time which is assigned to the correct purchase installment. 
I’d say it sorta resembles an online Lay-Away program only in this modern day and age you get to receive & begin enjoying your purchases right away as long as you pay the first payment upon checkout. 
This app handles it all beautifully, all the info you could need or are looking for is readily accessible within the app and I’ve yet to come across any glitches or issues. Only request I’d have is that it would be convenient to be able to forward a detailed receipt via email if for any reason you need to.",5,FALSE,Convenient,Bookobsessedgrl,12/17/2020 14:57,
"I first started using Afterpay last month when I made a rather large order. The idea and the concept is really cool but the app is a pain to use. I made the first payment on my order two weeks later as scheduled and it gave me a notification saying that the payment went though and it gave me my new remaining balance. Two days later, me email gets bombarded with emails from Afterpay saying that my payment was declined and they had tried to take the payment over and over again when it didn’t work the first time. When I first authorized the payment on the app, I had the money to cover the payment. When they tried over and over again to make the payment, it overdrafted my checking account and put me in the negatives screwing me over for groceries. 

Just recently, I had to make a switch to a new debit card through my job and when I tried to add it to my payment methods, it kept saying “Oops! There was an error in your billing information! Please try again!” Even though all of my info was correct. I went to the customer support section and found out that until the first order that you made is completely paid off, you can’t add another payment method! This service is not convenient at all and is a massive headache to try to use. I am going to pay off what I owe and I’m never using Afterpay again. I definitely would NOT recommend them to anyone.",1,FALSE,Very Frustrating,FTGW21,11/28/2019 0:43,
"Streamlined app that makes it easy to find the stores you’re looking for and even easier to keep track of what you’ve purchased, when payments are due, and how far you are into your payment plan. The only drawback is that not every website that partners with this uses Afterpay in the same way, so you have to navigate it a bit through trial and error to figure out what you’re doing. For example, some websites have Afterpay listed specifically as a form of payment, but then don’t link to your app to login- and others don’t have Afterpay listed as an option, you have to have the Afterpay card set up on your phone as a form of Apple Pay and then keep the app open while you’re using Apple Pay on the store’s app (this is how Lululemon does it). I thought it wasn’t linked for Lululemon for a while, and then thought that it was broken as a payment system until I did enough trial and error to figure it out. 

Once you’ve gotten the hang of it, though, it’s smooth sailing.",5,FALSE,Convenient and simple once you get used to it,cadencedsilver,1/13/2021 4:04,
"I have been using Afterpay for about 2 years now. I have spent thousands of dollars through them. I faced financial hardship due to COVID. I contacted them and they were very nice and said I would have to make my next payments until July. I really only needed a week or so to get my financials in order. I paid it off a few weeks later. I really appreciated them being so cool and I love that about this company (I had to do it once before when my card came up with fraudulent charges).

Now that I’m back to work I’ve been trying to use Afterpay like I had before. To my dismay and as another reviewer put it, I am being “punished” for my not being able to pay on time. I completely understand that this is a business and they can’t just go off the promise of the customer that they will pay. I just hate the way they go about it. I have been allowed to make a few small orders which I have been paying off early but I usually get an message telling me I need to pay off some things before I can order anything else (understandable). I paid off 3 payments and still wasn’t allowed to order anything at all. So basically they lied. This app is pretty much useless now.",3,FALSE,Love it but...,Tjoykashmir,6/6/2020 5:51,
"This is the only App I’ll ever write a review on! It’s great! I’ve never been able to shop more comfortably in my life! I’ve been using after pay for a while now and I have been able to redo my whole wardrobe and then some! I recommend this app/payment method for anyone who is hesitant to shop. They split the payments in 4! And you pay every other week... and with all these new updates they make it a lot easier if you need to make smaller payments in between, reschedule a payment for whatever reason or pay your items off early if you can! I definitely RECOMMEND Afterpay. Also the most professional rather than those other Apps (I won’t say). I may have had one issue with Afterpay but it wasn’t even there fault it was the company using Afterpay. But they are super fast with refunds and great on customer service if ever there is a issue.

"Such a great app and a great idea! I have used other 4 payment apps like this and they arent bad either, afterpay is my favorite because of the pulse rewards! It motivates me to pay off my payments earlier so I can get the point towards my 30 purchases so I can get the extras like no first payment when I order! There is a geeat selection of name brand stores as well as stores I have never heard from before and would never know about if it wasnt for this app. Small businesses need our help more then ever right now and this is a great way to do that! There is also an in-store payment option for some of the places as well!!! The app is great design wise too, so easy to navigate and has it all broken down for me so I know what I have to pay and what is paid off etc. It also makes its super easy to make my bi weekly payments, just a click of a button and its done! They send you a reminder email a few days before your payments do so you never forget!

I hesitated to buy any items that I couldn’t pay for or that I had wanted for a long time that were a little out of my price range. I came across Afterpay and absolutely love that I can now get the items I want and pay in four separate payments instead of all at once!!! This allows me to buy things I never could afford before because if payment installments I now do not need to take a large chunk of money and splurge once or twice a year instead I can buy whatever I want and pay over the course of the month. For the average working person this is an awesome app and awesome way to love a little luxuriously more than maybe you could have before this app was invented. I make my payments on time and am never charged any extra paying only for the items I purchased but if you are late the fee is not real exorbitantly high. Thank u Afterpay you guys seriously rock!!!

"I was fairly new to using Afterpay, having to go online each time to check my payment schedule or my order information, it was so slow and glitchy as my connection is not that great.

Downloaded it, and within seconds I had my orders there for me, with my payments shown and what is still owed on a little color circle ⭕️ chart.

"So I just got word that I needed steel toe boots for my new job and I was super low on cash and also certain types of boots fit me differently I range from Men’s 8-9.5 and I was looking into stores that were nearby that accepted Afterpay and had the boots I needed and in my size because there is a “order online and pick up in store” feature I was also looking for because I wasn’t going to be in town for my new job that starts right after Super Bowl, and couldn’t risk it getting my boots in on time.

"These folks at Afterpay truly care about us. Regular, hardworking people. They truly want us to be able to have nice things but still able to afford it. I’ve been using Afterpay for months and have found it to be the best payment option. I have used other “Payment Apps” but Afterpay is truly the only FREE one. The only way they would charge you is if you’re late on a payment which is nearly impossible because Afterpay e-mails you 4 days prior letting you know you have a payment coming up. No extra percentage to pay, no extra fees, nothing. I ran into some trouble and send a hardship form to Afterpay to see if they could delay my payments and they delayed my payments not only to the day I said I can resume but they went ahead and added an extra week so I can make I’m able to pay them.

I really love afterpay, I use it to buy myself new shoes, sports bras, skincare products, etc that I can’t afford to pay outright for. It’s awesome. My only complaint is if you don’t have money in your account at 12am the morning you payment is due they count you faulty, instead of doing so if your payment isn’t paid by midnight the day it is due. I always pay my payments the day they’re due, the majority of the time I even pay them crazy early, so to have them count against me despite getting money in my account later that day (pay day) and making my payment is frustrating. I’ve never been a day late, always paid the day they’re due if I’ve not paid them earlier so I feel they should revise that. Other than that I’m just afterpaying my way on up.

"Afterpay is the best way to purchase items when you don’t feel like draining your account. Or better yet to buy an item that is otherwise to expensive to purchase as one of your normal everyday items so just think of that $250 hair styling tool you have just dreamed of but just didn’t have the money all at once to purchase the item. WELL..... purchase thru Afterpay and pay in 4 consecutive payments that are 2 weeks apart from one another. What a GREAT IDEA!!! I basically purchase everything through Afterpay!! My one and only complaint which is minor for the normal population as I’m disabled and only receive my paychecks once a month. So it would be so great for me if Afterpay would base their payments on your payscale or do once a month like QVC.

"I was very excited to use this service but at one point I needed to update the payment information and the app would not accept my card, but it was telling me that payments went through. Yet they were not posting. I called customer service and the rep just wanted to show me how to add a card - which I already tried three different ways - instead of listening to me that the app was not accepting it. So he HUNG UP ON ME. I called back and a new guy let me know that the app doesn’t always accept payment methods and it can be done on a desktop. So the app is crap.

Additionally: I tried to update my password and the app would t accept that and told me that the password I was tying to use was TOO SIMILAR TO PASSWORDS ON OTHER ACCOUNTS - which means Afterpay has granted themselves access to all of my passwords!!! I NEVER authorized this. 

This company is VERY sketchy - they make it sound like they are doing something for you,  it they are taking access of your personal information when you install the app - so consider this before doing business with this company. I won’t use them anymore, and will likely stop ordering from the company that roped me into using them (DSW).

It’s as simple as pay the first payment and go... they don’t use credit limits, just split into four and can be paid off at any time you want rather than force you to make the payments until it’s paid off, and doesn’t charge interest. They work with you if you need to move the payment date too! They work with large amounts of money too!

All these years I never opened a line of credit. Heck I never even owned a credit card!! I mostly eschewed banks as well, sticking to cash and online payment systems during since their inception. So essentially..  I have no credit!

As a grown adult, it was starting to be kind of a pain. Kind of embarrassing. On one hand I never had to deal with the woes of financing and monthly payments like most of my friends. On the other, I had to basically save and buy everything up front. And could not do things that required credit checks. Like, signing for an apartment lease. 

Enter AfterPay. It’s teaching me how to responsibly make payments without “The Man” watching over. And it’s so,so much way cooler than Fingerhut (which if you are my age you know what I mean). 

So thanks, AfterPay, for making me choose my financial decisions more carefully and responsibly, and for not putting the ol’ credit score ball and chain on me.

It’s a great tool for getting the hang of managing your money very simply...and you don’t have to wait to purchase something you love until you’ve saved enough, only to have it be gone/sold out, or to inevitably use that money for something else just because you have it...saving is very challenging when you have money burning a hole in your pocket!

"I started using afterpay a year ago. Even then it was great but in the past year they’ve become amazing.  They have the best rewards system hands down. The only thing that I would change would be allowing for more time when rescheduling payments.  If I’m rescheduling a payment it’s probably because it would be a huge help to reschedule until next pay period, not just a few days. And, my one interaction w customer service was meh. They just directed me to read a page rather than answer my question, (the page discussed the topic but did not have the answer) but it wasn’t an important question so no biggie. It goes to show how good they are if I haven’t needed customer service in a year!

I recently discovered a new online superstore and they offered AfterPay so I tried it. LOVED IT! No shady credit checks or unreasonable interest rates (no interest at all actually.) I’ve used AfterPay at least 6 times now. I used to only be able to have 3 orders at a time but now I’m on a very generous credit limit! I hope Etsy and EBay join the AfterPay community soon!

I made a purchase with an Afterpay retailed, which Afterpay took its first payment and it cleared my bank but then me an email a few days later saying that the order was declined. I called the retail and asked if they could confirm this with me and they told me nothing was cancelled, just the shipment was on hold waiting to be processed. I have been emailing and submitting messages on Afterpay with no response. I haven’t even asked for the money back yet, I just want to know what is going on. Usually when I have a question, I get a response fairly quickly and it’s done with. I looked at Afterpay on BBB and it’s not good, a lot of issues with returns and sending people into collections.

Just make sure you make all payments on your account the day they’re due. They will send you payment reminders in advance to make sure you have correct funds in your account before each payment is deducted. I like to make a payment in advance sometimes if I have the extra money to. I have watched my credit amount ( spending limit ) go up and up consistently. I always receive my orders very fast.

EVERY TWO WEEKS! 
They’re super amazing and truly understand consumers! Anddd you have a 10 day grace period to make your payment before you get charged an $8.00 late fee charge! 
THANK YOU AFTERPAY for creating something super amazing that doesn’t require a credit check and ridiculous interest rates and gives a pretty awesome 10 grace period!

The reason given was that my Afterpay balance was too high. It was $53!! Really? So I paid what was due. STILL did not get approved for a purchase. I’ve had 3 purchases going at the same time with no trouble and the balances were higher than $53! I’m beyond irritated since now my afterpay balance is $25 and I still cannot make a purchase!

Years ago due to a divorce I went from excellent credit to horrible credit so I currently don’t have a credit card that I use so your service has given me the freedom to make purchases and pay for them over time. If there was anything that I could ask you to change it would be for you to report all positive and negative payment reports to the credit bureaus.

"I am enjoying the after pay app and experience so far.  My only problem is the lack of knowledge that they provide concerning shipping issues that arose that I became aware of by representatives that when you use after pay, even if you upgrade and pay for faster shipping they will charge you but automatically knock down processing and shipping to regular.  I think that information should be stipulated and people should definitely not be charged those extra $15 or more dollars for 2 day or overnight shipping if the company isn’t going to ship it on those terms just because it being paid in intervals.  The money is still received from the company and they should honor what consumers are paying for and process and ship items accordingly.

WHY AM I PAYING FOR SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT EXIST?? I contacted the merchant and they said there is no transaction from Afterpay. So why won’t Afterpay refund me?? This app is complete bullsh** and I’m so furious. I would highly NOT recommend this app unless you enjoy your money being stolen.

You don’t need to have credit or good credit. All you need is your debit card or credit card with your name, and you add your address. For example from that credit they loan you. Let’s say from 600$ you only consume 80 dollars you divide the 80$ in 4 payments. So when you buy something that is worth 80$ you give a down payment of 20 dollars. And then the rest on the date they tell you. You normally give 2 payments that same month of your purchase and your last 2 payments the next month. If you are faithful with your payments you can adjust your payment dates later on.

Some stores seem to have a smaller choice on the app than on their regular sites, which is weird.  I am a regular on ASOS and Bed Bath and Beyond.

The only negative reviews I’ve seen of this app appear to be people that made the classic mistake of overextending themselves on items they probably shouldn’t have purchased in the first place. Nothing to be ashamed of, it happens to all of us at some point. With this, it is next to impossible to get a late fee if you have automatic payments.

It started off so well with afterpay and I had no issues until I made a big purchase and ordered four products. I wasn’t happy with two out of the four products so I returned them in store and got my money back. A couple weeks went by and my payment never changed and customer service was just the worse. It’s so difficult to get a hold of them and when you do they’re useless. They did nothing for me and made me pay the same amount for the four products when I only had the two left. Sure I got my money back but I had to give it back to afterpay. I also cancelled an order and it’s been more than seven business days and I haven’t received a refund and I’m still scheduled to pay for something I cancelled.

I can’t believe this app is real! I’ve been using it for about 3 months now and I can’t tell you how many orders I’ve placed. It’s easy and paying biweekly is great. I usually pay weekly when I get paid but I love the option to not have to pay for something expensive or inexpensive all at once. You can pay ahead of time or on time. And whatever day you order on is the day two weeks from now in which your card will be charged. So to make things easier buy things it on payday so you know you will have the money on time. The payment is split into 4 payments equal payment and a first payment is due when your first purchase is processed. Doesn’t get easier than that 😉,5,FALSE,The BEST!!,aleyybabyy,6/23/2020 2:02,

Then tried to buy something with it, another error with both in app and through the store (since it reroutes to the app for payment) and had to use desktop.

So my first experience was not great due to me being preapproved for an amount of $600 it was Christmas time plus COVID and I really thought this company was going to pull through during Black Friday and cyber Monday. Unfortunately it only allowed one order and that was it and only allowed the dollar amount I spent which was like $75 dollars. Two months later I showed $250 preapproved and it allowed two orders at one time. Comparing this to QuadPay I’ve had better experiences with that company right away as soon as the payment is paid off I get to spend again unlike Afterpay I have to wait for a while.

Only complaint I would make is being mislead in one way. I was approved for roughly $600 and as I shop for my family for the holidays I am stopped by Afterpay informing me that I have to finalize payments with them for pending orders in order to continue using my $600 credit. In other words pay off some of your orders if you would like to continue shopping. Was not very happy with that.

"have been using afterpay for months it was a great way to shop. One day I lost my debit card. I use a credit union that is in another city so it took two weeks for me to get a replacement card. This already was obv A HUGE HASSLE ALREADY. 

I called to left the ppl at afterpay know AS SOON AS I REALIZED that my card was linked to my account and not my paypal, which I previously thought. They said that was fine I could defer the payment for two weeks while I wait for the card NBD. WHAT THEY DIDN’t tell me is that I’d be penalized for the late payment. Now to make matters worse I can’t get approved for an order over $50. 

IT’S NOT LIKE I DIDN’T HAVE MONEY IN MY ACCOUNT. 

Someone SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT MY LATE PAYMENT WOULD AFFECT MY STANDING AS A CUSTOMER. If I had known I would have gotten cash from another credit union (a sister branch) and purchased a pre-paid Visa card and paid that way.

We you call for assistance everyone is soooo nice but it’s too bad they can’t actually help you. The approval denial process is all determined by an algorithm, and apparently nothing and no one can supersede it even though everyone I have spoken with admits a mistake was made and they should have given me ALL THE INFORMATION so that I could make an informed decision as a consumer.

And it makes me not continue on with the purchase.  But this OMG.  IT DOESNT MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY.  it charges me small payments every two weeks and breaks up the total into 4 payments.  Literally for the first time I feel so comfortable. And I love it.  Thank you so much for who ever created this app.  And the no interest part ?? Cmon you can’t beat that.

"Love Afterpay.  For years I have thought larger item purchases should have the ability to be split in payments & paid over time (without affecting credit/relying on credit cards).  Afterpay does just that.  This service does what they say.  Afterpay conveniently & easily splits the total purchase cost into 4 payments (1 payment at the time of purchase & 3 more payments every 2 weeks).  The only thing better than 4 payments would be 6 or 8 for purchases over a certain amount.

I would LOVE it if we could have the option to “favorite” a store. And I would love it if more kitchen item-stores were to join Afterpay. Also, when you go to the “Card” section of the app, can the developers clarify what it means by “your down payment is due today”. It made me nervous for a sec that I had a payment due that I didn’t know about. I think it means that if I were to use the card to pay at that moment then my first payment is due?

Third you reply again with expressing frustration about how your question was unaddressed previously and was obviously not even read by the person responding to receive the same clip from their site with the part that still does not apply to me in bold now!

I contacted AfterPay for support but said there’s nothing they could do about it. Unfortunately, AfterPay does not advocate for its customer nor holds the vendors they work with accountable for their transactions. I finally gave up and paid 80 dollars for a product, from UMA oils, I will never received. Gladly the amount was small but can’t imagine making a purchase of hundreds or thousands of dollars with this company.

This shoe store (CSR) didn’t process my online return currently when I had returned the item in the store. The return didn’t circle back to Afterpay to credit my payments. Afterpay CSR explained that it wasn’t done correctly for me to receive my payment credits. Between them both figure pointing, I was out of a big chunk of money and no shoes.

Using after pay is a great way to help those during a difficult time when they can’t pay in full all the time.

If you follow the rules and make your payments in-time, I don’t see there being any issues. I have even been bumped up to VIP status so that now when I make a purchase, I don’t even have to make my first payment til 2 weeks out. How convenient is that? 

I use Afterpay for house decor, clothes/shoes, kids clothes and school supplies, furniture and so much more! It’s a life saver to get those big purchases broken down into interest free payments.

"AfterPay is the best multi-payment interest-free platform available to consumers and retailers. 

None of their competitors come close to being as organized and efficient.

AfterPay also allows you to level up as you build credibility by paying on time (which provides you with a larger stream of interest-free credit and delayed first payments).

I wish every retailer I purchase from would use AfterPay.

I am not a fan of QuadPay (app does not organize the consumer’s financials well and I don’t like to be confused when it comes to my money, especially when obtaining a refund through the platform) and I refuse to use Klarna.

I don’t want to buy 1 of something each week. Now I can buy a few things at a time without paying for it upfront. It’s much more satisfying this way.

Afterpay makes it so easy for me to find cool brands and to pay for it over time - without a credit card or interest. I bought boots from Thursday Boots, and I’d never heard of them until I got the Afterpay app.

Yesterday I get on the app, all the sudden I couldn’t log in and in red, it says “This account is currently unavailable. Contact Afterpay for more information.” 
I called them this morning asking why is my account apparently unavailable, they said it’s because I am under 18.

2. They offer small business a chance to be on the same level as major business. A small boutique can charge accordingly without fear that the major stores will out do the sell.. 
And they list the business they partner with on the site which helps both the customers and business because it becomes a one stop shop!

My order never came (the tracking number they provided was shipped to a completely different state) and the vendor has been completely unresponsive. I’m convinced the website is a scam. Afterpay reached out on my behalf and the vendor told Afterpay they are investigating but it’s been almost 2 months since I placed the order! What more is there to investigate? Refund me and be done with it.

Afterpay still requires you to pay the balance until the vendor can refund you themselves. I think this process is absolutely ridiculous if you never received your goods. They should handle refunds directly with the vendor and not put the weight and financial responsibility onto the customer.
