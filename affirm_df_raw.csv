"Kelly Biloxi, Mississippi",FALSE,9/28/2019 15:13,"Affirm has been so convenient to use with affordable monthly payments! Just download the app and apply for credit right from your device! No phone calls, no sales person to talk to. I needed a loan for a vacation I wasn‚Äôt prepared to pay for in full, well I was on my Orbitz app, shopping for a hotel/package deal I‚Äôd never heard of Affirm before they offered me a low monthly installment payment drafting from my personal checking account so I was able to pay for my hotel stay and round trip flight from New Orleans to Chicago for 2! Yes that‚Äôs right and was on my way within minutes! It‚Äôs so easy! 
I also needed an expensive gift for my son that I had promised him for Christmas and yes again I was buying new tires and wheels for his truck that day with preapproved credit card access. That‚Äôs right, Affirm actually provides you with a picture of a credit card within seconds and i just started shopping. Again, no call sales, no forms to sign and listen to this; no leaving the house to go pick up a loan check, take it to the bank and deposit it. I‚Äôve had 3 successful loans and plan on many more. I‚Äôve told so many of my friends and family about this app and it‚Äôs conveniences I feel like a walking billboard for them! Good luck and happy shopping!

I have been using affirm for a couple years now and it‚Äôs a excellent way to pay for what you need without spending all your cash at once or charging a lot on your credit cards. I have used affirm to pay for trips through Expedia as well as clothes and shoes from Nike. I love it! I could have paid in cash but then that cash wouldn‚Äôt be in my bank. I could have used my credit cards but then I would have to charge thousands on it and run my balance up. Instead I just pay monthly as I get paid and get everything I need and the best part is that I can prepay my balance at any time and save money on interest charges which is what I did when I paid of my Expedia trip to California! 
I love this app because not only do they have a great way to pay but they also have discounts for you when you shop which is great. 
I recommend this app if you need to build your credit or just don‚Äôt want to make big charges on your cards and want to keep some cash in the bank.

Alvie H,FALSE,9/28/2020 9:59,"Easy to use, pretty self explanatory app. Enjoyed it a lot to pay for a jewelry purchase.  However, if you make a payment, interest will still accrue while the payment is processing, which can take a few days. I made extra payments and set it up to do a final payment on the amount leftover, and had an item I thought paid off 1.5 months early, and I log into Affirm and it says I still owe 42 cents. Why would anyone pay all but 42 cents for an item? Affirms system left me unable to pay the remainder as I‚Äôll explain further. No problem, I try to pay the remaining 42 cents, but it cannot take a payment below $1. So I think okay, I‚Äôll pay a dollar, but no, it won‚Äôt take more then the balance due. This is not an acceptable set up. My interest rate is low so it‚Äôll be a long time before it‚Äôs accumulated to be able to make the dollar payment. I wanted to have it paid off as of the last payment. Which should have been the case. The app should not be set up in such a flawed way that people cannot be able to make early payments IN FULL and their loans be paid off. If anyone from Affirm is reading this, fix this bug in your system right away and make everyone‚Äôs lives a little easier. These flaws only hurt consumer confidence in your system.",4,Overall good but...,

This is for legitimate purposes and like any other banking world tool, you have the same control and responsibly. The idea of allowing payments overtime without interest accruing is a true bang for buck deal for consumers and merchants. I think it may make the marketplace reflect more reality and therefore act as a stabilizing influence. It‚Äôs covering a broad base as well allowing people to recover from losses, share wealth and slowdown waste.  Thank God! Really great idea and seems like a cleaned up improved idea from others.

Doesn‚Äôt make much sense to replace one tire at a time, so at bare minimum I needed to get two.

They have an extremely extensive listing of participating retailers in multiple categories such as clothing (including super high end like LV), beauty, home appliance & furniture stores, and even some major airliners plus travel services such as Expedia! Travel expenses, especially if you need to make plans last minute, can be extremely costly, so having the option to use Affirm to fund your purchase instead of putting it on a credit card is awesome. I also love the fact that you can get an estimate of the amount you may qualify for, and that the total you‚Äôre ultimately approved for isn‚Äôt fixed. Another thing I appreciate is not being penalized for paying off my loans in advance. Oh, and the app is just as fantastic too.

valdeza12,FALSE,8/4/2020 14:38,"I had canceled an order because Affirm told me I asked for the exact purchase amount, but apparently you need a ‚Äú5 dollar buffer‚Äù to process a payment.  So if your total was 450 for a PlayStation, you need to ask for 455 from affirm.  This is where the fun begins lol. Target had ‚Äúalready processed my purchase and therefore Affirm started a loan. Target Customer service denied that because a purchase isn‚Äôt fully processed unless you show up at the store and swipe your card. I reached out to affirm to let them know my order was canceled and that I was given a refund. Affirm takes 3-45, yes that‚Äôs correct! 45 freaking business days to process a refund! So I‚Äôm stuck with a 500 dollar loan until affirm decides to process my refund, which we are now on day 28. Target even cautioned me that affirm could take the full 45 days for them to give me the refund, which is ridiculous. Affirm tried deflecting the blame on target but it stated in their policy that even though you have been give a refund for a purchase, affirm will still take ‚Äú3-45 business days to be credited‚Äù

Even with my terrible credit I received 15% which is much better then the 19-21% on cards I get. 15% is still high but for those with even better credit would reap much better benefits. Got 450$ financed for only 38$ in interest over a 12month payment plan. And the app is very easy to use. And doesn‚Äôt start the actual payment day until your order is shipped. So even thou my Order was placed on sept29th. I would log on affirm every day and watch it go from the 1st. To 2nd to 3rd and add by 1 every day until the 7th when my package arrived at my house. Which is great because the high quality websites I use have parts coming from Germany directly for my car and so shipping takes 1-2 weeks and instead of being 2 weeks into my order and having 2 weeks to pay my affirm account It didn‚Äôt start the payment dates until i received my items.

This happened time and time again for a total of NINE paid off loans without ever having a late payment. Recently I had a large revolving credit line with not even half being used, the app decided to pre approve me again and I was informed they could not approve me for a loan and the decision was final. There have never been any late payments to this day, NOT ONE. I still have 4 open loans and have paid them on time as well even through this pandemic. I emailed Affirm and the generic robot replies I received clearly indicated they didn‚Äôt read or care about what I had to say. One of the deciding factors was my PAYMENT HISTORY or lack there of with the company. They use trans union for credit approval but report to Experian who shows I have 100% payment history with never a late payment. There were more issues but I‚Äôd be here all night typing.

JODy@1966,FALSE,4/2/2020 16:06,"I found this confusing at first but probably because I skimmed everything and didn‚Äôt read everything.  When I was first given the loan it looked like a check and I didn‚Äôt realize that had to be used for one purchase only and what was left over wasn‚Äôt usable.  I was booking a trip so I applied again for the AirBnB and the loan I was offered was much lower but covered where we were staying.  That had my total loan at around 500 because I started paying it back and wanted to secure my car, I was then declined because they could not establish who I was suddenly.  I have since tried 3 or 4 times but to no avail so I wrote in to the company today to see what was up.
     Until the not being able to know where I am the program was a cool app to use you just really need to have what you want already found and be able to have it as a single purchase.

I was approved for about 2500$ I made purchases at multiple retailers. Thought nothing of it till I seen my credit report. My fico went down for having a consumer installment loan. Not knowing having 9 loans at the time. Also it shows as closed accounts when paid off. So safe to say my score will be going down yet again because I now only have 3 loans left so. I will have 7 closed accounts on my report (originally had 10 from affirm all equaling 2500$ in total) so although you get approved for one lump sum. If you shop at different retailers it will all come up individually on your experian. 

Also before finding all this out I paid down my loans and attempted to get another for an emergency and was denied twice. First time for supposedly being unable to verify identity smh and second for having two many open loans even though the balance was down to less than 1000$.

On top of that you can even pay early to stay on top of your purchases. In my experience with returns, they are a breeze. I sent back the product I bought to the company I purchased it from ( ECS Tuning ), and within three days of leaving my local FedEx there was a return taken right off from my affirm payments.

What I do not appreciate is when I moved, it has been a royal pain in the tail bone to get my address and phone number changed. It is irregular to most companies where you can edit the info yourself; rather, you give them your new phone number and then await a call from them hoping it will come through at a convenient time so they can verify you actually changed the information. God forbid someone else grabbed your phone and changed it for you. I have played phone tag with them for over a year and my billing address/phone number are still incorrect. It‚Äôs ridiculous.

On my current loan (no interest), my extra payment in the amount of $1100, only granted me only month grace. The Affirm help center was unhelpful and I had to get a customer service number from a third party site, which is also new and very disappointing. The initial representative, as well as the Supervisor were unhelpful and basically told me this is how we process loans, despite previous patterns. To correct this issue, they have to reverse the extra payments and I have to go back into to the app to make 7 individual minimum payments in order to ‚Äúpush out‚Äù my next payment, which is very frustrating.

When you login Affirm will tell you the amount that you‚Äôre prequalified for, without staining your credit report and score with hard inquires. You can choose your repayment terms, whether that be 3, 6, or 12 monthly payments. You can sign up for automatic payments, or manually submit payment of a monthly basis. Either way, Affirm provides timely messages via text message and/or email as a reminder when a payment due date is approaching.

Affirm reveals up front how much you‚Äôll pay over time in interest for a loan,  but also allows you to skip paying interest altogether. You can repay your loan in full, without penalties, at any point.

Affirm what is your point please?!!!! Klarna, Shop and Afterpay are so awesome. You get your refund as soon as the store receives your returned item.

Affirm has adapted to the online-age and made applying for and paying loans super easy and simple. I can keep track of my balances, see the progress of loans and get a clear picture of when they will be satisfied. 

I love the new feature of the pre-approved loan amounts that allow you to create a virtual card for a ton of stores. Although I‚Äôve yet to use it, it‚Äôs a nice little peace of mind knowing I have that option. Lots of stores have 0% interest if paid within a certain time frame so why not?!
