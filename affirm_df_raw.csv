"Kelly Biloxi, Mississippi",FALSE,9/28/2019 15:13,"Affirm has been so convenient to use with affordable monthly payments! Just download the app and apply for credit right from your device! No phone calls, no sales person to talk to. I needed a loan for a vacation I wasn’t prepared to pay for in full, well I was on my Orbitz app, shopping for a hotel/package deal I’d never heard of Affirm before they offered me a low monthly installment payment drafting from my personal checking account so I was able to pay for my hotel stay and round trip flight from New Orleans to Chicago for 2! Yes that’s right and was on my way within minutes! It’s so easy! 
I also needed an expensive gift for my son that I had promised him for Christmas and yes again I was buying new tires and wheels for his truck that day with preapproved credit card access. That’s right, Affirm actually provides you with a picture of a credit card within seconds and i just started shopping. Again, no call sales, no forms to sign and listen to this; no leaving the house to go pick up a loan check, take it to the bank and deposit it. I’ve had 3 successful loans and plan on many more. I’ve told so many of my friends and family about this app and it’s conveniences I feel like a walking billboard for them! Good luck and happy shopping!

Jaystradamus78,FALSE,3/19/2021 7:06,"I’m a Youtuber Jay Moore Reviews and I review movies, tv shows and products. I have been using affirm for a couple years now and it’s a excellent way to pay for what you need without spending all your cash at once or charging a lot on your credit cards. I have used affirm to pay for trips through Expedia as well as clothes and shoes from Nike. I love it! I could have paid in cash but then that cash wouldn’t be in my bank. I could have used my credit cards but then I would have to charge thousands on it and run my balance up. Instead I just pay monthly as I get paid and get everything I need and the best part is that I can prepay my balance at any time and save money on interest charges which is what I did when I paid of my Expedia trip to California! 
I love this app because not only do they have a great way to pay but they also have discounts for you when you shop which is great. 
I recommend this app if you need to build your credit or just don’t want to make big charges on your cards and want to keep some cash in the bank.
In the end trust me you will be happy with the service 💯",5,Excellent Way 2 Pay!,
Alvie H,FALSE,9/28/2020 9:59,"Easy to use, pretty self explanatory app. Enjoyed it a lot to pay for a jewelry purchase.  However, if you make a payment, interest will still accrue while the payment is processing, which can take a few days. I made extra payments and set it up to do a final payment on the amount leftover, and had an item I thought paid off 1.5 months early, and I log into Affirm and it says I still owe 42 cents. Why would anyone pay all but 42 cents for an item? Affirms system left me unable to pay the remainder as I’ll explain further. No problem, I try to pay the remaining 42 cents, but it cannot take a payment below $1. So I think okay, I’ll pay a dollar, but no, it won’t take more then the balance due. This is not an acceptable set up. My interest rate is low so it’ll be a long time before it’s accumulated to be able to make the dollar payment. I wanted to have it paid off as of the last payment. Which should have been the case. The app should not be set up in such a flawed way that people cannot be able to make early payments IN FULL and their loans be paid off. If anyone from Affirm is reading this, fix this bug in your system right away and make everyone’s lives a little easier. These flaws only hurt consumer confidence in your system.",4,Overall good but...,
Hooded Qobra Ent.,FALSE,4/28/2021 11:39,"Started the app up fine, gave all my data, once I was in there I clicked on “prequalify” and it denied me, saying “you can not be approved for THAT amount” when I never clicked on any amount, all I did was put in my yearly income I didn’t put in an amount I was trying to get approved for..and not it won’t let me use the app for 30 days?? What kind of business is that? 

Then there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY to get in contact with ANYONE. I went through all the FAQs, help info “contact us” which does NOT give you a way to contact anyone, all it does is gives you generic “issues” to choose from and it just directs you to articles on it. My issue is NOT on the list and there is no way to add it as an issue. So how can they have a FAQ if they don’t allow people to ask questions??!! All I want to do is talk to someone and tell them what happen and see if it was ma error and or get to the bottom of why it did that... I don’t usually write reviews, unless the app is excellent, or it has frustrated me to this level... this app has potential to be awesome, but it’s left a bad taste in my mouth from the beginning. Affirm, if you are listening please chime in, say something contact ME since I can’t contact YOU, and maybe I will chance my rating and review..

I received a notification today that affirm found me responsible for the charges of which there has been no documentation or true investigation completed. These purchases were made WITHOUT MY CONSENT. I called immediately after seeing these transactions on my PNC bank statement and asked them to be cancelled. THESE ORDERS WERE IN FACT NOT CANCELLED and I received notification of that yesterday. If these transactions are NOT removed from my account and NOT refunded to me I will be discontinuing ANY AND ALL further activity with you, as well as seeking legal action. This is absolutely ridiculous and not customer service in the least. These transactions were completed with a “virtual card”. How did a virtual card even get linked to my account in the first place? I never received emails about the purchases until yesterday stating that the “loan had been accepted,” AFTER I CALLED AND ASKED IT TO BE CANCELLED DUE TO FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY. It is clear that affirm has no respect for the security of my information, or that of others using your services.

I gave 4 because it’s not that old yet. The lists of merchants using Affirm are pretty respectable as well. This is for legitimate purposes and like any other banking world tool, you have the same control and responsibly. The idea of allowing payments overtime without interest accruing is a true bang for buck deal for consumers and merchants. I think it may make the marketplace reflect more reality and therefore act as a stabilizing influence. It’s covering a broad base as well allowing people to recover from losses, share wealth and slowdown waste.  Thank God! Really great idea and seems like a cleaned up improved idea from others. I think(hope) it’s pushing out the disingenuous, those, seeking to fence stolen goods, sell knock offs or set up other various online scams. At least so far, so good. As far as I know I’m the biggest mouth around calling fouls. I call myself too if I’m wrong. We all need integrity & accountability to have respect for each other.

I had a huge expense essentially eliminate all of my savings at the time, and wouldn’t you know it - suddenly I needed more money for a flat tire. Doesn’t make much sense to replace one tire at a time, so at bare minimum I needed to get two. I had a few days left before payday so I needed a good chunk of money to make my purchase and I was talking to my sister, who told me about Affirm. It was so simple. No credit check. No hassle. I put in my information, and was approved for way more than I needed. Making a purchase was just as simple too!! This app is so easy to maneuver, and to get the money you need - and to pay back. The interest rate is high, but if you pay it back early and timely, the amount paid towards interest is worth the ease and ability to borrow money from a lender from an app. No phone calls, no pesky questions, no credit checks, and I get money for my purchase. It’s amazing. You cannot use this with Apple Pay or to send money through Western Union or any of those apps.

NissanSkylinePDX,FALSE,5/16/2018 21:21,"This is a such great financial service. I really like the fact that there are no hard credit checks performed and the terms are not the same as a traditional credit card where there is a revolving balance. They have an extremely extensive listing of participating retailers in multiple categories such as clothing (including super high end like LV), beauty, home appliance & furniture stores, and even some major airliners plus travel services such as Expedia! Travel expenses, especially if you need to make plans last minute, can be extremely costly, so having the option to use Affirm to fund your purchase instead of putting it on a credit card is awesome. I also love the fact that you can get an estimate of the amount you may qualify for, and that the total you’re ultimately approved for isn’t fixed. Another thing I appreciate is not being penalized for paying off my loans in advance. Oh, and the app is just as fantastic too. Super easy to navigate, straight forward FAQ/answers, and is very aesthetically pleasing. I am so, so thankful for this service, 5/5 stars all around!",5,Awesome Service & App!,
valdeza12,FALSE,8/4/2020 14:38,"I had canceled an order because Affirm told me I asked for the exact purchase amount, but apparently you need a “5 dollar buffer” to process a payment.  So if your total was 450 for a PlayStation, you need to ask for 455 from affirm.  This is where the fun begins lol. Target had “already processed my purchase and therefore Affirm started a loan. Target Customer service denied that because a purchase isn’t fully processed unless you show up at the store and swipe your card. I reached out to affirm to let them know my order was canceled and that I was given a refund. Affirm takes 3-45, yes that’s correct! 45 freaking business days to process a refund! So I’m stuck with a 500 dollar loan until affirm decides to process my refund, which we are now on day 28. Target even cautioned me that affirm could take the full 45 days for them to give me the refund, which is ridiculous. Affirm tried deflecting the blame on target but it stated in their policy that even though you have been give a refund for a purchase, affirm will still take “3-45 business days to be credited” 

Also, you still have to make payments because it will affect your credit! Yay! This is what is so frustrating about their return policy. They need to make returns faster because I will never service again, and would definitely not recommend this trash to my friends.",1,CAUTION,
Davie N.,FALSE,10/11/2019 7:38,I have poor Credit and was very happy with the help of affirms financing. It’s great and cheap. Even with my terrible credit I received 15% which is much better then the 19-21% on cards I get. 15% is still high but for those with even better credit would reap much better benefits. Got 450$ financed for only 38$ in interest over a 12month payment plan. And the app is very easy to use. And doesn’t start the actual payment day until your order is shipped. So even thou my Order was placed on sept29th. I would log on affirm every day and watch it go from the 1st. To 2nd to 3rd and add by 1 every day until the 7th when my package arrived at my house. Which is great because the high quality websites I use have parts coming from Germany directly for my car and so shipping takes 1-2 weeks and instead of being 2 weeks into my order and having 2 weeks to pay my affirm account It didn’t start the payment dates until i received my items. Will be using affirm from now on over any financing program for a long time currently.,5,Very good financing,
Covey's,FALSE,6/30/2020 2:29,"So I started using Affirm back in 2018. I started with a lower approved credit amount but paid the first one off and I was able to get an increase. This happened time and time again for a total of NINE paid off loans without ever having a late payment. Recently I had a large revolving credit line with not even half being used, the app decided to pre approve me again and I was informed they could not approve me for a loan and the decision was final. There have never been any late payments to this day, NOT ONE. I still have 4 open loans and have paid them on time as well even through this pandemic. I emailed Affirm and the generic robot replies I received clearly indicated they didn’t read or care about what I had to say. One of the deciding factors was my PAYMENT HISTORY or lack there of with the company. They use trans union for credit approval but report to Experian who shows I have 100% payment history with never a late payment. There were more issues but I’d be here all night typing. I was so happy and pleased with Affirm, I bought things I wanted and rebuilt my credit, they made money off me. Was a great win win for both parties.

JODy@1966,FALSE,4/2/2020 16:06,"I found this confusing at first but probably because I skimmed everything and didn’t read everything.  When I was first given the loan it looked like a check and I didn’t realize that had to be used for one purchase only and what was left over wasn’t usable.  I was booking a trip so I applied again for the AirBnB and the loan I was offered was much lower but covered where we were staying.  That had my total loan at around 500 because I started paying it back and wanted to secure my car, I was then declined because they could not establish who I was suddenly.  I have since tried 3 or 4 times but to no avail so I wrote in to the company today to see what was up.
     Until the not being able to know where I am the program was a cool app to use you just really need to have what you want already found and be able to have it as a single purchase.  I haven’t given up on the app just because the simplicity of it is great!  It truly was the easiest line of money to get and pay back.   Give them a shot",5,Affirm App,
Bunny. J,FALSE,6/4/2020 10:07,"This app came in handy when i needed! BUT please understand each loan you take no matter the size does show up on your EXPERIAN credit report. I was approved for about 2500$ I made purchases at multiple retailers. Thought nothing of it till I seen my credit report. My fico went down for having a consumer installment loan. Not knowing having 9 loans at the time. Also it shows as closed accounts when paid off. So safe to say my score will be going down yet again because I now only have 3 loans left so. I will have 7 closed accounts on my report (originally had 10 from affirm all equaling 2500$ in total) so although you get approved for one lump sum. If you shop at different retailers it will all come up individually on your experian. 

Also before finding all this out I paid down my loans and attempted to get another for an emergency and was denied twice. First time for supposedly being unable to verify identity smh and second for having two many open loans even though the balance was down to less than 1000$.

Affirm allows me to make the purchases I’ve always wanted, but could never afford on my current budget. Both the IPhone App and the online website have such a user friendly display. It shows you precisely when and how much you will need to pay each month along with the total left of your entire purchase, including the breakdown of what you are paying for. On top of that you can even pay early to stay on top of your purchases. In my experience with returns, they are a breeze. I sent back the product I bought to the company I purchased it from ( ECS Tuning ), and within three days of leaving my local FedEx there was a return taken right off from my affirm payments.

They also have an option every time you log on to see if you are prequalified for future spending. No hard credit check for this either.

I used Affirm to buy the mattress and everything has been wonderful. The process to borrow was fast and simple, the interest rates are relatively high but that’s assumed with companies like this - that being said, if you pay it off quickly and in lump sums you save on interest fees and essentially get it for a decent price with the interest.

I wouldn’t use this all the time or in a frivolous manor, but it def is great to use on purchases like I mentioned above. I haven’t had any problems with Affirm.

I don’t think it’s up to me to certify with this merchant as to whether or not they are gonna supply merchandise. Affirm wants my money it should be up to them to settle the matter, they haven’t given me any money so in my eyes I owe them nothing. I’ve went ahead and paid my payment on time becuase I don’t want my credit messed up but if I haven’t received the merchandise by the time the next payment is due Affirm won’t be getting another payment from me and I will be turning them into the BBB. You can’t charge someone for something they haven’t received and if that said company has already paid the merchant than they should take care of the issue.

What I do not appreciate is when I moved, it has been a royal pain in the tail bone to get my address and phone number changed. It is irregular to most companies where you can edit the info yourself; rather, you give them your new phone number and then await a call from them hoping it will come through at a convenient time so they can verify you actually changed the information. God forbid someone else grabbed your phone and changed it for you. I have played phone tag with them for over a year and my billing address/phone number are still incorrect. It’s ridiculous.

Now I want to purchase something else, and can not get approved.  So despite having over a 750 credit score, having never missed a payment, carrying high balances and all else, having the other affirm loan counts as a high balance apparently.

The initial representative, as well as the Supervisor were unhelpful and basically told me this is how we process loans, despite previous patterns. To correct this issue, they have to reverse the extra payments and I have to go back into to the app to make 7 individual minimum payments in order to “push out” my next payment, which is very frustrating. Thankfully, there are more installment loan companies arising, so I can take my business elsewhere since Affirm has changed they way they do business.",2,Changes to extra payments,

Basically after shopping online and obtaining the full amount of a purchase, you can click over to Affirm, request your loan, then be given a virtual credit card to complete your purchase with a merchant. 

When you login Affirm will tell you the amount that you’re prequalified for, without staining your credit report and score with hard inquires. You can choose your repayment terms, whether that be 3, 6, or 12 monthly payments. You can sign up for automatic payments, or manually submit payment of a monthly basis. Either way, Affirm provides timely messages via text message and/or email as a reminder when a payment due date is approaching.  Affirm allows payments to be authorized and submitted via text message. 

Affirm reveals up front how much you’ll pay over time in interest for a loan,  but also allows you to skip paying interest altogether. You can repay your loan in full, without penalties, at any point.

When I asked to speak to a supervisor I was essentially told no twice before finally getting someone else on the line, and the supervisor was just as unhelpful. 

The last time I called, I was told that all the information I had previously received was incorrect and they were talking to a back room to figure out what was going on. When I asked for the back room or other departments number, I was told they wouldn’t provide it.
