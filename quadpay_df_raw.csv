I have had to make quite a few adjustments. Much of the time it has been financially. I have had to decide against getting the necessities of life for ‚Äòme‚Äô. I had wish lists and loaded shopping carts on various websites, ‚ÄúWindow shopping‚Äù, and hoping. Remembering the words of Kevin Hart, ‚ÄúI would, but the way that my bank account is set up...‚Äù lol. Then when I desperately needed a pair of pants that fit after having the babies. I began checking online clearance. I was so discouraged, and about to skip the first family gathering with everyone in three years since my grandmother passed. She was the only one that could get us all to come together from across the nation. I was on the Fashion Nova site and was given QuadPay as an option of payment. I was instantly relieved. I began to see advertisements for other businesses. I felt totally liberated. A forth payment up front was a lot easier for me. The app and service is hassle free thank goodness. It notifies you of your next payment status and when your due. I have had four or so orders from two servicers. I plan to use a third/Apple in a couple weeks.

It‚Äôs been awesome, worry free, and hassle free so far. Thank you so much!!!!!",FALSE,"Whoot whoot, I love it!!!!!",2/10/2020 4:50,5
,A1TSD,"I love being able to have the ability to purchase online things in payments without it going against your credit. However, I do not like the refund process and I think it should be revised. I purchased an order through a website & used Quadpay. The package said it was delivered but was never delivered (at least not to me). I filed a dispute for merchandise never received with the merchant, carrier, & my bank. I tried to with Quadpay but they told me they can‚Äôt stop the payments because they have to wait on the merchant to advise them to process a refund. However, I knew the merchant wasn‚Äôt going to do that because it shows as delivered in their system & the carriers. The merchant eventually came back to me and said they are closing my claim because it shows as delivered and quadpay will not process my refund. So I am just going to have to go through my bank. I feel like me going through my bank could have all been avoided if quadpay had additional refund options for those who do not receive their merchandise. I understand it‚Äôs a safety precaution for those people who do scam but for us people who are truly innocent and did not receive our merchandise, it is a bummer. I have to jump through hoops to get my money returned. I dont feel I should pay for products never received. Packages are mis-delivered and/or stolen unfortunately...overall good app & love the simplicity. Just wish there were additional refund options & not just up to the merchant....",FALSE,It‚Äôs okay...,11/7/2020 7:36,4
,Can't find an available one,"I‚Äôve completed and paid off one purchase so far and transaction and payments went smoothly. I‚Äôve recently used the app again for another purchase however I was being indecisive and was browsing the site and re-arranged 2 times before I finalized and completed the purchase. The 2 times I entered amount for purchase while debating went through and now my checking account has 3 separated pending transactions for payments. The first 2 that I was debating and the 3rd one I actually completed the purchase. The FAQs state the 2 will drop off however it makes me nervous and I‚Äôll have to follow up to ensure they reverse. I think your account shouldn‚Äôt be charged the 1st payment until you actually finalize the purchase instead of when you enter the estimated amount of the purchase. Also, you are provided a set limit of funds available with no options to request an increase. I understand this isn‚Äôt a credit card but I feel like if you‚Äôve completed payment of orders then you should have an option to request a small limit increase. Or perhaps it should automatically increase a little after every completed order payoff. Other then that it‚Äôs convenient and I appreciate being able to make purchases on payment without having my credit score impacted via credit card utilization percentages. I‚Äôll revise my review if the pending charges aren‚Äôt reversed and dropped off.",FALSE,So far so good..,10/12/2020 1:57,4

Ready to check out, I noticed the QuadPay option of 4 breakdown payments and with a wedding in the near future, I‚Äôm trying to save/manage every penny! Not to mention the app was compatible with the SUPER50 promo(1/2 price sale) the website was offering. Half off + 4 payments + A card to add to my apple wallet = Highest Appreciation!!!
On a technical critique, I noticed being redirected from the original website into the QuadPay app, the usage was very choppy/lagging, not sure if its bugs in the latest version or if internet traffic from the FashionNova sale was causing a delay. However the slow interaction made it extremely difficult and highly frustrating to complete the purchase, especially since I personally didn‚Äôt understand the check out process of selecting QuadPay as the pay process (this redirected me back to the checkout screen multiple times and caused ‚Äúerrors‚Äù) vs the actual solution of removing my own debit card info and replacing it with the new Visa card info which is given to the user in the app. Please consider making a smoother checkout transition for new comers.

,Lcalcrazee,"I am a huge fan of all of these alternative method options (afterpay, sezzle & now quadpay) in today‚Äôs world, the primary consumer is burdened by overwhelming student loans and often times pays more towards that balance per month than they do for a mortgage or car payment, so it‚Äôs a relief to have options for large purchases. I like that quadpay has a vast variety of top retailers available to use their program with, but it does not come without a cost (hence the 4 stars) the only reason that QP didn‚Äôt get 5 stars is due to the $1 fee on each scheduled payment. Afterpay/sezzle does not do this, but they link directly to ones credit or debit card vs. quad pay which utilizes an interim unique credit card number specific to your account/transaction & QP has a lot more ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù retailers than its competitors, so I can see how the $1 would be justified but it does seem a bit steep. I‚Äôd recommend trying to get the retailers to foot some of that $1/scheduled payment as they will almost certainly see some incremental sales volume, as a direct result of being listed on QPs site, especially as QP grows in popularity. Even $.50/scheduled payment seems much more reasonable. Just a thought!
Either way- very efficient and effective, quick - easy to use and little information collected. Great job overall!",FALSE,Easy & effective payment method,12/2/2019 11:03,4

Mamaw don‚Äôt get to watch Roku channels or the news because some little one thinks the remote is hers lol. So I bought us each a tablet and a few other things. The tablets were such a good deal! I had to push copy the Pay with QuadPay button a few times. I think it said I already had a card registered. The last time I pushed and copied it went through smoothly.I think it was because I already had my bank debit card registered. I shop at Target a handful of times a year. It‚Äôs an hour away so I only have Walmart around here. It‚Äôs nice to see different things. The only bad thing is getting me out of the store lol! I stay at home most of the time. I know most everyone is on a budget. Christmas is coming. I know QuadPay is a great way to get the things you need if you have can‚Äôt pay a large lump sum up front.

,JRnWV,"When I saw the ads for this app honestly at first I was skeptical. Then when I was approved almost immediately for $200 limit just answering a handful of simple non invasive questions I was even more sketch. I needed a new PS4 controller and GameStop was an approved store. I was almost broke that week and thought I‚Äôd have to wait a whole couple weeks just to jump on the PS4. Well I got some trade ins together and landed in GameStop and the two employees were completely unaware of any program like QuadPay and made me feel really nervous that I was wasting my time. Finally after explaining what it was again they called another store to see what they said and they totally backed QuadPay and I up. Now neither myself nor the two seasonals had any experience with how it was gonna work or what to do. You just follow the instructions after they give you a total, get in your QuadPay app and select the store you are out and it will ask you to type in the total amount due. Seconds later it shows you yours amount due today then the other 3 installments. Never have I ever got to do the tap thing to pay using my phone but I did with this purchase and it absolutely worked like a dream.

I tried to order through Sephora 5 days ago and kept receiving an error message after submitting the order - then quadpay charged me for my first payment of $48 - normally you can cancel a transaction however the app has very limited options and it wasn‚Äôt appearing. It‚Äôs been 5 days and I have only received automated responses and two times they sent the same response - proving you can‚Äôt talk to an actual person. Therefore no one is reading what I‚Äôm actually saying in my message. So now I am currently stuck with paying $200 for items that I will not be receiving as they were never properly ordered or processed through Sephora. I have recently received a message stating that I need to go through Sephora to resolve this however neither my beauty insider account or their info proves that an order was processed because of the error with payment  - and since quadpay does not have actual people responding to you - I don‚Äôt see this being resolved unless I cancel my card and claim fraudulent on their part because that‚Äôs what this is beginning to feel like.

,I'm rich B*tch!!,"I heard of Quad pay a little while back but I never used it because the stores I shop at weren‚Äôt apart of their affiliate program. I downloaded the app recently because it said shop at ANY store. Which is true. I purchased a $130 tool at a hardware store online and went and picked it up next morning after only paying first or 4 interest free payments!! I‚Äôm happy. Wife‚Äôs happy. Come to find out she‚Äôs not new to Quad pay. And this is how she buys her outfits online. 

The only problem so far is this, and it‚Äôs more of a problem for the developers to solve is that YOU HAVE TO HIT PURCHASE AT THE RIGHT DURING THE PURCHASE PROCESS IN THE SHOPPING CART!  If you fail to do so quad pay will prematurely hold first payment funds and the RETAILER will try to process full purchase amount.  It was kind of tricky because I wasn‚Äôt sure how it all worked. There‚Äôs no need to give your card number to retailer. Quad handles it. But you must hit pay at the right time. 

Good news is. The mistake was corrected quickly. The balanced held against my account was released almost immediately and I went back and tried my purchase again no problem. (Like is said this is more of a new user mistaken that could of been prevented by the developers.)",FALSE,Credit card killer!,10/21/2020 17:45,5

While on the list I used QuadPay through primitive again with no issues. I was able to pay both off no problems. Once I was approved for the QuadPay card I had issues tried to make a purchase at Under Armour and the payment only processed for part of the purchase amount. I couldn‚Äôt get the QuadPay app to work so I called Under Armour and canceled the order. They said they will issue the refund.

,sierranoels,"The thing about QuadPay is your not paying interest the payment for whatever you are buying is literally just split in 4 payments every 2 weeks they put the money up front for your purchase but your basically paying back QuadPay if 4 payments.

What I normally do is go to the search page type in ‚Äúmakeup‚Äù so many stores with different prices from ulta and Sephora have cheaper prices with the same products. I would of never known without QuadPay. Did I mention every time you spend the amount of money you spend determines the amount you‚Äôll be preapproved for so if you spend 250, ounces it‚Äôs all paid up it will go into your pre approved for another purchase.

,13_Akane_13,"QuadPay is actually the second app I‚Äôve used to make split payments on purchases. I have found that there are actually a number of these that I‚Äôd never heard of until now. Anyway, I do like this one better than the other one I had used because of the card you can use. Most of these programs have certain businesses they‚Äôre affiliated with that you can purchase from which can be limiting if the place you want to shop from isn‚Äôt on the list. I‚Äôm assuming that you need to make a purchase through an affiliated company and pay it off before they give you a card balance but once they do, you can request a certain amount (up to the amount they‚Äôll allow. Right now I have 200 I can spend) that you want to use for a purchase and they will create temporary credit card information that you can use anywhere that takes Visa or Amex. They charge a few dollars fee and then you just pay off your balance over the next six weeks like normal. I like to shop from some less mainstream shops so this is great.

Another issue is that a hold is placed on the pay account for the first payment before the requested amount can be used.

And that amount will not fall off preauth and available on Quadpay until days later. HMPH.

Know exactly what you want to spend before you request because you can only have three open orders at a time. All in all, genius app! The flexibility of four payments is sweet!

Thought I would share some tips on using QuadPay:
1. Use a bill budget app that lets you see your bills for the next 60days. You need to make sure you can afford the payments ahead of time. I like to use the app Prism! It‚Äôs FREE and it can link to bill companies and banks. FREE. If you don‚Äôt want to link your bank, use the payday feature and set your future min. Pay that you get weekly, bi weekly, or monthly.
2. Don‚Äôt use QuadPay for something you might cancel because of size issues like Clothes, shoes,etc. i see a lot of people complain about refund issue. Buy what you already know you will keep. With hopes that nothing is broken or damaged of course.
3. Talking about refunds- When using instore method, WAIT UNTIL YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH YOU ARE USING TO REQUEST FUNDS FROM QUADPAY, basically when the cashier tells you your total. Round to nearest dollar or exact amount. So what if people are waiting behind you.
4. If you might struggle paying (4) $80 payments for next 2 months then don‚Äôt use $320+.Avoid crazy late fees.
5. I use QuadPay for things I need and do it in one transaction. Thank God I was able to get my family Christmas gifts! I wasn‚Äôt able to drop $$$ at the time. I was able to manage the payments.
I don‚Äôt recommend using it for crazy shopping, only what you need and emergency. 
Remember, this is better than a CC or a small loan, no interest!

The only issue I recently came across is that I tried to purchase 3 pairs of sneakers online from Footlocker. One pair of the shoes was coming from a different store so i was receiving it as a separate order.

But after see this added amount for the 2nd time in trying to use, I‚Äôve just decided to never use it now. Missed out on an item I wanted because I chose to find another method of payment after seeing what QP was going to try to charge me.

All you need is a phone number to get started, some personal info and a debit/credit card to pay back purchases.  I love the fact that items can be purchased by paying a reasonable small down payment (due at time of purchase from your debit card/ credit card) then the remainder is broken into 4 payments to pay over the next 6 weeks and Quad pays the remainder balance (with a virtual card that you copy into payment info section) for the item at time of purchase.  There is zero interest. You will receive an initial balance mine was $300 these balances vary I‚Äôm not sure what Info is used to determine the balance you will receive.

The service allows you to browse online storefronts within the app, which is incredibly convenient.

I would recommend finding your desired purchase in a dedicated web browser, then locating them in the QuadPay browser to save some time. This is a very minor gripe, and the app is still fresh so the browser will no doubt improve over time.

The primary function of the app works perfectly. The process of breaking large payments up into four smaller ones might be a bit confusing at first, but the app helps you every step of the way.

Its like a credit card without all the other extra fees and interests and its better than worrying about late fees or forgetting to pay off your card because as long as your card has funds they deduct it on their own so you pay off faster.

Best of all, since it‚Äôs only 4 payments it‚Äôs done before you know it. I highly recommend keeping this for more of the necessary purchases;
As with everything if not used responsibly, you can certainly get into trouble with making too many unnecessary purchases because of the fact that you‚Äôre only paying 1/4 down.

Guys...This is a new company that is offering an amazing service to those of us with less than phat cash to spare even before the pandemic. Imagine the number of new customers they have now, that they never in their wildest imaginations, could have anticipated. I know this is a tough time for us the consumer, but we have to consider what the online business is going through right now.  Most often, they have like 10 employees to start. I‚Äôm just saying I get it.  Your declinations probably are not because you aren‚Äôt qualified, but somebody is taking the time to answer each and every complaint. I mean... come on guys.

a little story: I had a bit of anxiety after my 2nd order because I did it a bit weird.

Another thing that i love with it is that i don't have the need to use a credit card for my own personal needs due to a higher interests rates that comes with it.

One of the features I like the most about it is the ability to set limits on how much you would like to spend. I also love the search feature - to me, it makes finding stores/products less time-consuming. 
Another plus is, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a spending minimum to take advantage of Quad Pay (it is my favorite plus thus far)!
My only complaint is that I would like to have a more in-depth breakdown of what I owe and when it is due. Through my exploration of the app, I‚Äôve found a basic overview of it, but I have not found a more detailed record.

Another point is the instructions arent so clear on what you need to do in order for the Quad to work on a specific card through the app. iE making you copy paste the ‚Äúquadpay card‚Äù (which is just one of your cc cards) but if you happen to make a purchase at an online store once before they save your payment (info ie an old card.) so its a bit confusing on what card you will be paying Quad pay on.

I feel it should not ask u that just let u make ur purchase.. because it take the 4 payment amount from what u plan to use not what u actually use.. for example my total was like $68 But the app ask u how much u plan to use in $100 increments so I had to chose $100.. so In 4 payment I had to pay $25 for the first payment But 4 payments of $68 would not equate to $25 each payment but $17 each payment.. so pretty much I feel your first payment should come from your actual total not the estimated $100 increments u plan to use..,FALSE,Quad app,8/5/2019 1:08,4

,betvip67,"I think this genius and really cutting edge in the realm of finance. The credit usery is not too much and not too little. Meaning the credit limit is just the right amount. This can be a very useful remedy to lighting the consumer spending load and help the consumer free up cash flow. Great for someone on a fixed income or in between paychecks. Easy to use. However there is a little back in forth as you have to consider tax and shipping costs prior to making a request of credit. I think there will be a better execution to this application in the near future.. overall great concept.

Even with a savings account, I was behind in my bills which caused my credit to suffer. I exhausted my reserved funds to pay for basic necessities.

I finally caught up with bills (for the most part...) and then suddenly, it was November and time to Christmas shop for my kids. I cried for hours. How was I going to give my kids a decent Christmas? I had no money in savings and I was using most of my paychecks to catch up or pay bills.

I applied for a loan, and was denied. I applied for a credit card, denied.

Then I found Quadpay.

Tried to make another purchase yesterday, but I was declined and managed to use 4 different cards and was consistently refused.
I even changed the store and lowered the amount to the bare minimum. I have good credit. The cards HAVE money in it.

I have been using it for a bit but it‚Äôs pretty buggy the customer support is kinda sucky to cancel an order is a hassle but ya know kinda a customer service issue but I was told I got a higher credit(never saw any difference) and it puts payment reminders on your calendar that are so annoying but it works if you can get approved you can use it basically anywhere",TRUE,It‚Äôs only gotten worse,11/17/2020 16:43,1

I‚Äôve used other apps like this and have never had an issue hence is why I decided to download and try this app. I‚Äôve emailed and was sent an auto-message but have not heard anything back since sending the email as to why I was rejected.

,jvatter49,This app is super helpful especially if you have children and need last minute birthday gifts or maybe anniversary gifts for your spouse. The only issue I‚Äôve had is getting approved for a higher limit. I‚Äôve had the app for almost a year and paid every payment on time but my limit is still 150$. Other than that I highly recommend this app.,FALSE,Very helpful,5/31/2021 16:13,4
,Starsigma,I like the option when needed to be able to pay in parts. However ever since I got my new debit card I keep getting errors for unable to charge because the card has expired.

It takes the card without issue in the app. If it doesn‚Äôt use MasterCard then it shouldn‚Äôt take it in the app initially.,FALSE,Good but has some issues,4/20/2021 15:28,3

,WBBrose,"Using QuadPay was great until I started having issues with the company not want to approve orders. The message says it‚Äôs because they had to review my account. Well, I have always paid on time and paid in full. I tried calling them but guess what you can talk to anyone. They ask you to answer questions and to email them. Again you can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs crazy!
