Anne,5,FALSE,AnneBeebanannie,2/18/2021 5:07,I have nothing but positive things to say about Varo. I absolutely love this bank!! They are there for the people who literally live from paycheck to paycheck and cover for me if the need be. Every other bank I had stole so much of my money from me!! It actually sickens me to calculate the expenses that they sucked from me in overdrafts and even extra overdraft fees on top of the $35 every single time I needed them to be there for as a valued customer who banked with them for years. Not once in 10 years did they help me. The worst part is I now know how badly they treated me by holding my money for weeks at a time holding back my government benefits every month for 10 years. It‚Äôs unethical and wrong to treat anyone that way charge me an overdraft fee when you have had my money when I needed it most and charged me over and over and over the figure comes up to several thousand dollars when I actually saw what they had so unfairly done to me by switching to Varo holy cow praise Jesus they have treated me more than fair and I will always give VARO praise. Thank goodness you showed me what the old bank had been doing to me I am so glad I switched to Varo they are the best bank and their customer service over the phone is outstanding. Like I said in the beginning I have nothing but praise to say about this bank Varo is the best bank I ever had!!!! VARO ROCkS,
Best there is. Love VARO.,5,FALSE,Manic Bobo,5/25/2021 13:43,"I switched to VARO almost 4 years ago. I got fed up with my two other brick and mortar banks (that I only went into twice in 15 years). Got tired of the attitude and delays in doing anything with them. I could never understand how they could bugger things up when my banking needs were really very basic and simple. I picked VARO over several other online banks because they were polite, helpful, and everything happens faster than my other bank. The transition from VARO money to VARO bank has been painless. My daughters and two of my friends have switched to VARO. VARO suits my needs perfectly. I don‚Äôt use much cash, don‚Äôt deposit many checks, direct deposits are posted 3-4 days early. The few checks I have posted through the app processed quickly and without any issues. The few times I‚Äôve needed cash, they have ATM access just about everywhere. The app and Home Screen widget are great.  Only bank I‚Äôve ever dealt with where I haven‚Äôt found a single thing to complain about, or had a single problem.  The only real semi-issue I have found is if a payment requires a bank cashiers check, banks won‚Äôt issue one wo an account in their bank, but I found the places wanting cashiers checks can be talked into money orders.",
Going on 3yrs,5,FALSE,SweeTsOkc,1/6/2021 3:07,"I‚Äôve been using Varo since 2018, and it‚Äôs pretty cool. I‚Äôve also banked with Chase, IBC, and MidFirst. A physical bank comes in handy if you‚Äôre living paycheck to paycheck and need that money on your card that day. Varos‚Äô answer; if you have direct deposit then you can get paid early like with other popular apps. So that‚Äôs even better. And if you‚Äôre not in a rush you can just take a picture of the check and it‚Äôll be in there the next day of the week. And you can deposit cash by green dot cards. But the customer service is better than any other bank I‚Äôve had. And I‚Äôve yet to run into any issues. They are also always ontop of the new. They were one of the first to get the cards you can just tap like Apple Pay etc. idk I‚Äôm easy going so this bank works out well for me. And the early pay is cool. If you need a bank I‚Äôd recommend this Forsure. If your bank is troublesome or anything switch over. If it‚Äôs not then only switch if you need to get paid earlier",
Nothing but ongoing issues since they switched to Varo Bank,1,FALSE,Nacita Moore,3/4/2021 21:28,"Since Varo received their charter to become a bank there has been nothing but ongoing issues with them ever since. From glitches with activation to account glitches, swiping your card and paying for items glitches, weird account error message glitches...I got annoyed with it all and moved my DD back to Chime temporarily hoping that maybe one day Varo will get it together and I would potentially switch back. I did leave my account opened to deposit and cash checks via mobile deposit. They used to have a great turn around time with that. I have been using this service for over a year or two. Well now they are slacking in that area also. Banks make their money based on how much funds you hold in your account at the end of the day. So you would think they would be doing everything they can to keep their customers happy. Hmph not this bank. It was fine when they were Varo Money. I don‚Äôt understand why they chose to switch over. It‚Äôs been nothing but chaos ever since. I‚Äôm to the point where I am so disappointed with these folks that I am about to close my account completely. I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I gave them many chances and months to redeem themselves. I‚Äôm so disappointed especially after speaking so highly of their services.

Why did you take away so many useful things?,2,FALSE,Dominicanfella,12/17/2020 17:44,"This app is worse than the original app. You should have kept the old one. I shouldn‚Äôt have to open the app to view my updated balance. The old app would let you see your balance via notification if you spend anything. Also when you make a transfer from savings to checking or visa versa there is no notification at all. You guys took one step forwards and 10 steps back. When someone send you money via Zelle for example, still no notification saying the money is received as well. You have to log in and wait to see the funds. It use to be almost instant with the old app. This update was the worst thing you guys have done. I was ok with updating my direct deposit and all those other things, but not giving the user proper notifications is not good. I need to be able to see what goes in and out of my account, and I see other reviews saying the same things.  Why change something that wasn‚Äôt broken? At least keep the useful things.

Horrendous deposit limits that competitors don‚Äôt have,1,FALSE,RandallG123,12/1/2020 20:16,"Came for the high interest yield savings (like most people) and cancelled my account within a month. Would‚Äôve cancelled sooner but I wanted to give the bank a chance. It‚Äôs the 1st of December and I still haven‚Äôt received my funds and it‚Äôs been over three weeks since I cancelled. Customer service‚Äôs feedback was ‚Äúthey‚Äôre escalating it and they‚Äôre not sure a check was even issued...‚Äù.I still don‚Äôt have my money which I saved for Christmas shopping and I don‚Äôt even know when I‚Äôll get it. To be more specific Varo has ridiculous limits (like tiny limit i.e $50) for the amount you can deposit into your savings from an outside institution. You can avoid the limit if you originate the transfer from the outside institution but many banks charge a fee for doing that. Ally bank, a direct competitor, doesn‚Äôt have any limits or restrictions like that. Essentially Varo tries to get you to utilize more of their services like their checking account (obligatory checking account by the way). They want you to get automatic deposits too, for example, and in return they will increase your deposit limits. On top of everything they made the cancellation process a nightmare. There are so many better options out there. Stay away",

I start calling each morning at 8:00 when they open for business. There‚Äôs no wait time mentioned then, but no one answers. I‚Äôll wait for an hour, then am told by the automated system that the wait time is less than 15 minutes. Um, no. It‚Äôs more like an hour. I don‚Äôt stay on beyond that. When called after 10:00 am, the estimated wait time is ‚Äú greater than 60 minutes ‚Äú.  Ugh. I just want to find out some important ( to me) information about a direct deposit that seems to be floating around in my old account. Emails aren‚Äôt answered either.

Do not use this bank!,1,FALSE,winteroutloud,6/5/2021 21:20,"I opened an account in March with Varo for their interest rate to help grow my savings.

You can dispute transactions, like you can with any bank, but they will not communicate to you at all throughout the process. Radio silent. If they have 2 months and 3 days to resolve a dispute, you better believe they will take exactly that amount of time to get you your money back.

Their customer service agents are all weirdo Mormons from Utah. When one of them finally gets on the line and puts the phone to their ear, all I can hear is the ocean. Thick as two short planks. Some of the stupidest people I have ever spoken to.

They will shut your debit card off randomly and leave you with no way to access your money to feed your kid. They will send a card in the mail, make you wait two weeks for it to show up, with no   Way too access your money, and the card never shows up! They never send them!

The only drawback recently has been due to the pandemic with lower federal interest rates so their savings account perks have dwindled a little bit but in my opinion they‚Äôre doing their best with what they have. For example their 2.8% savings cap used to be on $50,000 and then lowered to 10,000 and now it‚Äôs 5000 here recently but they increased the percentage from 2.8 to 3.

The $50 overdraft is a joke. Even if you pay it all back, it‚Äôs unavailable until the transactions that overdrew your account settle. I have never had a bank do this.

My money frequently disappears and reappears a day or two later. I am pretty sure they take more than they show you when you use your card at a place that involves a tip. They won‚Äôt show you a running balance, so verifying this requires starting at your last statement balance and doing the math of all your transactions to see what they are shorting you. Really dishonest. 

If anything happens to your card, you lose it, they think it maybe compromised, they will shut it off immediately and make you wait two weeks for a new one to come in the mail. There is no way to access your money while they are doing this.

The wait times when you ah e to call in are ridiculous. They cut off my card for fraud and I had to sit in hold for two hours to try to pay at 7 eleven.

"New App, New Problems",3,FALSE,Todd Hewitt,12/24/2020 22:13,"Like many other reviewers, I am not thrilled with the transition from Varo Money to Varo Bank.

One of the biggest appeals of Varo is the high interest rate for their savings account. Unfortunately, when I transitioned to the new app, all of my accrued interest for the month of December had disappeared.

I called customer support to figure out the issue, but waited on hold for 30 minutes with no answer before deciding to give up. I ended up sending an email and am hoping they can resolve the situation that way. 

I know transitions like this can be rocky and I‚Äôm hopeful for Varo‚Äôs future. If I get my money back and their customer service improves, I will make sure to update my review. But for now, I‚Äôm not happy and am definitely starting to look into other online banks.

EDIT:

Updated my review from 2 stars to 3 stars after the response from the developers below. However, this was not at all clear and should not have required leaving a negative review to get an answer.

So much taken away from old app and nothing better about this one.,2,FALSE,Penguins_fan24,12/30/2020 15:55,"This app is basically the exact same as the old varo money app, however there‚Äôs less to offer now then there used to be.  You can no longer mail checks to pay people or even get your own paper checks, which is frustrating because some of my bills haven‚Äôt got with the times and I can‚Äôt pay online.  There used to be a widget which was convenient and that‚Äôs gone as well.  The varo advance is also much worse if a service then the overdraw protection they used to have in my opinion.  You would think an online bank would have the best app since you have to do everything ‚ú®online‚ú®, but the app isn‚Äôt any better than other banks.  My other bank accounts have a feature to see your card digitally which makes online shopping way easier, it also would have made the transition way easier since we were forced to redo all of our existing subscriptions and what not with the new debit card number.  The only saving grace is the interest rate on the savings account, theirs is pretty much unbeatable.  However I can‚Äôt even use the save your pay feature because everytime I set it up it just resets back to 0%.  Overall not a pleasant experience going through the switch and having to use this mediocre app compared to the old one.  They really should have had a much better app in place and ready to go so it doesn‚Äôt feel like we went backwards.  Hopefully they can improve upon it and add some things that make them a truly good experience for an online bank.  Because right now you may as well just use a regular one.","{'id': 20112134, 'body': ""We're really sorry to hear you're upset about the switch to Varo Bank.

Varo vs Traditional Brick & Mortar,2,FALSE,Albuquerque Dukes,1/27/2021 6:57,"I have been a Varo customer from the beginning when Varo had the orange starburst looking debit cards. I loved the fact that Varo paid the highest interest on money in your savings account. What doesn‚Äôt make sense is they significantly reduce that interest if you have more than 10k in your account. Last December 23rd or 24th there was a technical issue that prevented you from using your debit card for purchases. Without any notification from Varo I attempted to use my card to make a holiday purchase only to have my card declined. Fortunately I‚Äôm not the typical under banked customer that Varo provides service to, so I just used a different bank card. What was troubling to me was Varo never sent a notification warning me or its customers that your card might be declined due to technical issues. After I left the merchant I tried to call customer service but after over 20 minutes of unanswered calls I just gave up. It‚Äôs nice to get paid two days early even though I personally don‚Äôt need that benefit. I know that Chime and other Fintechs provide that service as well. My biggest issue is there is a limit of how much money you can transfer from Varo to an outside bank monthly. So if you meet that limit and need to get a large sum of cash, you have to go to a Walmart money center to get additional cash. The problem is the maximum you can get from the money center is $2000 per day. Here is where the traditional brick and mortar is beneficial. At the brick and mortar you have a personal banker that you can call or go see personally if you have any issues that have to be dealt with. With a Fintech you‚Äôre stuck trying to reach someone on the phone. Good luck reaching someone with Varo‚Äôs customer service department. My advice is to get an account with your local credit Union. If you have kids open a Varo account for them for their convenience since they probably won‚Äôt ever have the need to physically go to the bank. I still haven‚Äôt gotten the new Varo bank card and I was literally one of the original customers. Varo is still experiencing growing pains and will continue to do so as they are now officially a bank with their own charter. My personal banker called me the other day just to see if I needed anything. That‚Äôs a call you will never get from Varo. Your experience with Varo will be fine if you don‚Äôt have any real expectations of your bank to go above and beyond to provide a great user experience. I personally realized that Varo is a nice secondary or tertiary banking option.","{'id': 20712520, 'body': ""We really appreciate you for taking the time to leave us your honest review!

Can‚Äôt believe how easy and legit this is!,5,FALSE,Dnsjaksjshshsv,11/7/2020 4:08,"First, I just wanna say KUDOS FOR MAKING AN ONLINE BANK OMG. I rarely leave reviews for apps, especially because most of the apps that I use don‚Äôt stand out to me as something I should review but anyhoo I had to do this. I have been with Wells Fargo ever since I moved to the United States and thought it was the best bank ever bc of their 24 hour customer service. (Obviously my standards are low) Anyhoo, 6 years later my savings account obviously didn‚Äôt acquire much interest bc A) I‚Äôm a student and B) their APY is 0.40% at best. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm so glad I stumbled upon this. This bank makes sense! I just signed up and I can‚Äôt wait to transfer my funds to build a savings account on here. I‚Äôm really happy with all the perks that is provided through this bank, the hassle free sign up, the no- minimum payment account creation, the no-overdraft fees and ofccc the high APY rate for savings account.

 I know it‚Äôs not traditional to use a bank like this but it beats these banking giants that have nothing to offer in comparison to what Varo offers. I am a CS major at Metro and I hope that I can work with you guys on the programming / developer side when I‚Äôm done with school. Really kudos with the app and everything you have done so far!!! üëè 

P.S. The app sometimes kicks you off when you‚Äôre using it, it did a Face ID scan and it kicked me off twice. 

Also, I was thinking that it might be more user friendly if you could automate the biometric scan on the login page for users who have opted-in for that option.",

I let him know that I was on hold for 5 hours and that it was an important matter, how I was not able to get in touch with my bank that is holding my money, not letting me sign in on the ‚Äúapp‚Äù and the supervisor proceeded to tell me it was irrelevant that I was on hold for so long, when I asked for his full name or at least his first name and his badge number employee number or supervisor number because I was disgusted with the service and disrespect from this business he proceeded to tell me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to give you any of that information, I only have to tell you my first name‚Äù. After trying to explain my situations, concerns and how upset I was to this ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù on a fake phone line he then proceeded to hang ip on me. I have now been on the phone since 9 this morning have not gotten in touch with one single live person that has treated me with any type of decent respect. When you call a bank you should be asked normal questions to prove your identity such as your address your phone number even your social which they ‚Äúshould have‚Äù access too. The fact that it takes multiple hours, days to get in touch with someone where you have thousands of dollars sitting in a checking or savings account. I will stop at no end to continue to let people know how horrible this ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù is. Please stay away and please get yourself a real bank. You will never get on the phone or a response from anyone. Which we all should have known since it‚Äôs just a fake app on the App Store with no branch. So I guess it‚Äôs my fault for trying to trust in someone new. Please please save yourself the trouble and stay away from this retched ‚Äúbank‚Äù!","{'id': 22643100, 'body': ""We're really sorry to hear about your experience.

A lot worse than the old Varo Money!,1,FALSE,C3Reviews,12/31/2020 1:35,"I have been using Varo Money (the old app) for about half a year and quite pleased with its services. Basically it fulfills all of its promises in terms of ease of use and great customer service. However, the new varo bank app is really a disappointment and few step backwards from the old one. I‚Äôll be blunt and say that the migration to this new app is an obvious inconvenience. I didn‚Äôt like that the company didn‚Äôt offer any apology and just act like they are doing us a favor claiming this is an upgrade. You would have to update your direct deposit at your workplace and all the autopay services that you are subscribing too. This process could take a long time because of the verification of the new account. That‚Äôs why they offer the 60 days to soften this hassle/annoyance, but claiming that it is an easy process and not owning this inconvenience to the customer is rather dishonest and non-transparent on their part. 
By the way, the activation of the new debit card is not that easy. You will get a new card delivered to your address you have on their file. The instructions say you can activate with the app or call the 1(877) numbers. I tried activating with the app which required to enter 4 last digits on the card and expiration date. It didn‚Äôt work. Tried like 5 times and gave up. Then I called the number, pressed ‚Äú2‚Äù to activate the card, followed the instructions and then was told to download the app to activate it. At this point, I feel like this is beyond stupidity. Why can‚Äôt they just stay as Varo Money? Now I need to deal with their customer service to activate the card and somehow Im already feeling this new card is not as reliable as the old one. I was thinking of using it on the holiday while traveling but now just to be safe, this card needs to prove it‚Äôs working fine before going with me anywhere.
I really hope this Varo Bank or whatever is not the beginning of the downfall for this company. Bottom line is that they have definitely been changed from good to worse. Just keep that in mind and try Ally or Chime if you‚Äôre new to online banking.

Update: called customer service as recommended to get card activated and was told that the migration is having some technical difficulty. So they couldn‚Äôt activate the card. Then I waited 4 more days and called again. Put on hold for more than 1 hour 30 minutes:( I gave up. Spent so much time solving this simple issue","{'id': 20121390, 'body': ""We appreciate you for taking the time to leave us your honest review.

Nice but needs some work,3,FALSE,ZPB4Life,4/26/2021 16:46,"I have been using Varo for a couple of years now.  I like it ok.   There‚Äôs no ridiculous fees which is definitely a plus.  

Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt been all that impressed with the transition.   With Varo Money, fraud issues were much easier to dispute.  They were very intuitive. A few times they were already working on investigating suspicious purchases before I even noticed them.  I do prefer the simplicity of the older app too.   I get that it‚Äôs a whole  process but Varo Bank needs to do some work to get it together.  I do have a few pet peeves  though. 

1) I hate that in the new app I get the log out warning message EVERY SINGLE TIME I open it.  I get it, I was idle too long so it logged me out. But if I‚Äôm using FaceID just skip it and let me log in.  It‚Äôs a little aggravating.   

2) Also, there are times when I need to do mobile check deposits without a $2000 cap.  Mobile deposit should be convenient. That‚Äôs the point right?   It‚Äôs a pain to have to find a place to cash the check then pay 2 separate fees to load the max $1000 to my account. 

3) monthly bill pay would be a nice feature to have too. 

4) Customer service.  I can‚Äôt say if it‚Äôs good or bad cuz I can never get anyone on the phone.  I do mean never. Call when they open around 8ish and each time I was on hold for well over an hour.  No exaggeration.  It‚Äôs bizarre.  And I thought it was just me but I‚Äôve noticed other reviewers say the same thing.  And the email support is worse.  You get an auto reply when you submit a help ticket.  2 weeks ... that‚Äôs how long it took to get a real response.   I had forgotten that I emailed them.  

 Maybe I‚Äôm being too picky but I just need it to work better for me.

"Cool bank, suddenly a little disappointed",3,FALSE,BrokeIsBetter,2/6/2021 2:10,"I‚Äôve been banking with Varo since they were Varo Money and their features are cool and the platform is easy to navigate. I do however have a problem with a sudden rule they have implemented.

So I joined for the high APY which is 2.8% (also you have to qualify to get your paycheck 2 days earlier as well if you care about that) if you meet the qualifications which are:
‚Ä¢ Have at least $0.01 in your account and less than $10,000
‚Ä¢ Make 5 qualifying purchases (buy things, no bank transfers or atm withdrawals)
‚Ä¢ Direct deposit of at least $1,000 per month

These are fair enough terms. However, they have done something kind of sneaky in my opinion. Instead of qualifying from statement to statement they now make you qualify every single month. As in, on the first day of every month your APY is automatically reset back to .4%. (and your paycheck also comes at the regular time until you qualify again, I believe)

They changed the terminology in January. Which means until you get paid (for some workers this is the 15th/30th) you may miss out on the 2.8% APY for the first 15 days. Also, until you make the qualifying purchases - I don‚Äôt think I personally am excited to go swipe my debit card 5 times on the first of every single month especially in a pandemic (and I LOVE shopping).

This isn‚Äôt a big deal as you still get the 2.8% APY for at least half the year, if you‚Äôre lucky enough to get a paycheck on the first of the month - sometimes longer, which is great if the terms are explained properly, but I believe it is just sneaky and disappointing as someone who liked this company and their perceived transparency. It seemed very misleading and I wanted to give others a heads up.

They are the one of the highest among savings accounts for sure which is a safe option but I think the deceitful nature of this has me ready to close the account, currently looking at other options. There are other options out there and I highly recommend searching for them before settling.

Otherwise great app, great services, great customer service -  e-mail wise they usually take 3-5 business days and I haven‚Äôt been on hold phone wise for longer than 30 minutes. (: 
Cheers and happy saving!","{'id': 20911419, 'body': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave us your honest review. We appreciate your feedback. To clarify, no qualifications are required to be met to be paid up to two days early. Here at Varo Bank, we post direct deposits as soon as we receive notification from the Federal Reserve. Therefore, if we receive word early then we will post your funds that early. Otherwise, you should not receive your deposit any later than your actual pay date. Regarding your concern with our elevated savings feature, you are correct. Your eligibility resets at the beginning of each month so you‚Äôll need to re-qualify for each new month. However, when you qualify for 2.80% APY, you will earn the higher rate for that entire calendar month, even if you only met the requirement on the last day of the Qualifying Period.

"If it‚Äôs not broken, don‚Äôt fix it.",1,FALSE,Koroma123,1/28/2021 13:44,"I miss the original Varo it was so much better.

I started Varo last year and I really enjoyed it. Getting my money was extremely simple, my direct deposits came early, and communicating with representatives wasn‚Äôt a hassle at all. I understand with the Stimulus payments there has been extremely high volumes, but I‚Äôve been calling for days at a time and never received a call back. It took me a week to get someone on the phone. Also, they never answer emails so don‚Äôt even bother. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the glitches on this app. Originally accessing everything was very self explanatory and easy, now it‚Äôs like a puzzle to find everything. The original routing and account numbers were very easy and worked almost everywhere and were very simple, and easy with direct deposit. These new routing and checking numbers do not work with every employer, and some places say it‚Äôs not a valid number. Don‚Äôt even think  about using it for direct deposit for any government assistance or benefits it won‚Äôt work. They say it‚Äôs not a valid number. If you‚Äôre transferring money for cash app it‚Äôs not instant. It‚Äôs takes 20-30 mins to show up. If you make purchases at a gas station or a convenient store Varo takes all your money out of your account and doesn‚Äôt show up until the next day.

I loved the original app it was quick, easy, convenient, and really helped me save. This new app is egregious. Please do not download it. You will have so many problems and they will take forever to fix them. It‚Äôs not worth it. I‚Äôm leaving them as of Friday, do not waste your time. And as for you Varo.

I am fortunate enough to not live paycheck to paycheck but my recent experience with Varo truly reinforces why I left. I made a mistake updating my direct deposit and did not save my changes so my paycheck was sent to the closed Varo account. Banks have 5 business days to return the funds to the ACH originator and Varo of course is taking the whole amount of time lol. In my first review, hold times were consistently 30-60 minutes but now they are consistently 60+ minutes. If I could market my hatred for this bank I would. 

Final Update: I submitted an account closure request yesterday by email and that was handled within a day. I submitted other requests by email and they were never handled and responded to a week later. I am glad to have made the choice to move from Varo. They do not deserve any loyalty. 

Update: As of today I still have not received any responses from my emails sent six days ago. Varo replied to my App Store review and said to contact them by email lol. Why would I do that if no one is going to respond. Officially working on switching now. Again, I love the platform but it‚Äôs not enough to keep me. 

I‚Äôve been with Varo since 2019 and have LOVED banking with them. I‚Äôm not sure when things changed but now they treat you just like any other bank, like an account number instead of a person. Hold times are always 30-60 minutes and they do not respond to emails. I expressed my concerns when I finally made it through to a rep and they just didn‚Äôt care, even when I mentioned I may be switching because of it. I have my Direct Deposit split between two banks but will be closing out my Varo account very soon. It really is unfortunate because I still love the platform but I just can‚Äôt support a startup who grew because of our loyalty and am now being slapped in the face.","{'id': 22029534, 'body': 'Thank you for taking time to provide your honest feedback.

"Zero Security, Zero Support",1,TRUE,OLIVIA-NewYork,6/1/2021 19:02,"I had two fraudulent/unauthorized transactions take place on my account this week that totaled $2000. Varo responded by disputing the claim and closing my account. I am extremely disturbed. 

Full story is below but to sum it up: 
The Varo product is seriously flawed. It enabled someone to hack into my account and transfer money to another Varo user. Rather then helping me reverse the fraud, Varo closed my account (implying I was responsible) and went completely silent despite multiple requests for further detail or assistance. 

This complete lack of security is troubling from a bank and I would strongly warn anyone against using them. 

Full story:

I‚Äôve had Varo since early 2020 and use it for savings. I‚Äôve never taken money out of the account or transferred money to another account. 

On 5/26 I noticed two Varo-to-Varo (‚ÄúV2V‚Äù) transactions post to my account totaling $2000, which is also the limit you can transfer. I did not initiate these transfers nor do I know the person the money was transferred to. 

I immediately called Varo and filed a claim. Two days later received a response saying that their investigation was complete and they found no error and my account was being irrevocably terminated.

I have had no luck with any follow up support and was told that the only thing to do was to send an email to their support line. So, instead of helping me with the illegal fraud on my account, they permanently closed my account and have refused to deal with the matter.

Horrible online financial institute!,1,FALSE,JoEllenNmandyBestFriendsNdog,4/19/2021 2:41,"I joined Varo Bank sometime in March.  I liked everything they had to offer, so much so that I got all my direct deposits set up to go to Varo. Then I set up all my auto pay bills to withdraw their payments from Varo. Then the red flags started.  I sent them a question about something via email and they took days to answer but when they replied, it was only to tell me something like I made a good choice joining them, etc. didn‚Äôt address my question and I had to re-send that email which never did get answered. I had a dispute to file so since it was a weekend I had no choice but to send them an email.  But it wasn‚Äôt long before I found out that the transaction I was disputing turned out to be legit so I re-sent the email and told them to forget what I sent, I didn‚Äôt need to dispute, etc.  no answers from them on it, so it didn‚Äôt concern me since I told them all was okay.  I have a few direct deposits since I‚Äôm a senior citizen and disabled.  They all went through but the last one, it went to the former bank.  So I went to deposit a mobile check to Varo.  This is when I found out they are trouble.  I kept getting errors on the mobile check.  (Mind you, I‚Äôm a pro when it comes to online banking and to get errors on a mobile check is unheard of from where I‚Äôve been!) It didn‚Äôt have the same name as was on my account.  (Yes it did).  It didn‚Äôt have the right date.  (Yes it did).  Other errors that made no sense so I can‚Äôt remember.  I tried two times and got different errors and you have a choice of retry or deposit anyway.  The second time I tapped deposit anyway.  It took two days then I got an email from them stating it was rejected!  So I set out to do it all over again, same routine, and after I tapped deposit again I was so sorry I did because what made me think it‚Äôd have a better outcome, and I‚Äôm already late with the auto pay bills expected to withdraw out of Varo, I was freaking out.  So I had to figure out how to get that check deposited somewhere else and fast!  I managed to do so and all ended up well regarding my bills.  But, while all this was happening?  I called them.  First call I was told the wait would be over 60 minutes but I waited anyway, just set the phone down on speaker.  I waited for more than three hours before I hung up.  Called right back and waited two hours no answer.  Called again but didn‚Äôt make it an hour.  I don‚Äôt think they ever bother to answer their phone.  To this date they‚Äôve never answered my multiple emails on the subject and the emails were sent out on 04-11-21.  Today is 04-18-21.  I decided if they have no customer service for emergencies either by phone or email, I‚Äôm getting out of there right now.  And I did.  It was a lot of work but I had to re-direct my direct deposits and my auto pay bills to get out of Varo.  I would stay away from this so called financial business.

and bizarre  unauthorized transaction from a rental car company for over $3000.00 post to my account making it negative over $2000. Now i have not rented a car in over a year and I have never rented from this particular company...  I quickly filed a dispute, and was told it would take 10 business days to investigate.  And I‚Äôm not gonna lie at first I was like 10
Days!! That‚Äôs all my money in the world.. and what‚Äôs there to investigate.... so of course I got to googling other peoples experiences with Varo‚Äôs dispute resolution policies and i found quite a lot of people crying foul about investigations that did not go there way... and not getting any communication at all back.  I didn‚Äôt really find one positive account... I have to assume that just be because satisfied customers are less likely to leave a detailed review unsatisfied customers.

So I want to go on record and say that my expedited was 100% positive.. they did exactly what they said they would do, contacted when they said they would and promptly refunded my money at the end of the investigation.  Not a single complaint from me, and I thought about it and the few times I have had to contact
Customer support my issue has always been resolved to my satisfaction promptly... whether jt was mobile deposit limit increases, or over draft fee correction/reimbursement... always excellent... that‚Äôs all i guess... just felt
Like they deserved a positive accounting of they service out there for people to see.",

Big takeaway:  NO FEES for any of this.  and that‚Äôs the Bottom line.  The bank I transferred funds to charged me $15 though.  

So:  
FEES:  A+

Nonexistent customer service,1,FALSE,Stacy Ricardo,4/4/2021 18:58,"My true rating is zero stars. I‚Äôm not able to link Varo with simple things such as Quickbooks and similar apps. To make matters worse service has become increasingly unsatisfactory during their transition period to become a charter bank.  Starting with them not syncing my new phone number to the card they sent and requesting I take pictures of my identification and a picture of me holding my identification which I‚Äôve never had to do with any online bank before and find pretty invasive a picture of my ID cool but a picture of me holding it strange. Especially for a phone number update. It would be loads easier to verify via email the same as every other bank I do business with including Capital One which is completely i line as well. Furthermore, Capital One has never made such requests when updating info or verifying if I‚Äôm the actual account holder. They call I answer security questions or they send an email with a code etc. After this confusion I decided to close my account and have reached out to them via phone MULTIPLE times but the wait time is over an hour and they don‚Äôt have a callback option. I‚Äôve emailed TWICE with no response regarding the process of closing my account. If they‚Äôre trying to become a serious competitor of online banks like Capital One they have a LONG way to go. Their customer service is nonexistent, they have ridiculously long wait times so no one can get assistance, they don‚Äôt answer emails, they request identification verification in an invasive manner unusual from an online bank in my experience. Sadly, I‚Äôm truly disappointed with my experience I was excited for their transition and now just want to replace them with another bank that has fewer loopholes and actionable customer service. And, if  upon reaching out to them again they fail to respond and close my account to report them to Consumer Finance for failure to comply to my requests to close my account. I have no negative balance and my account is in good standing. This delay in my request makes no sense and only looks bad for them.

It's not going to be pretty.

Your apps are broken. My iPhone XS takes flawless pictures, my pictures are perfectly lit, I've worked in television studios for over 30 years, I know when things are well lit, yet your app says my ID pictures and selfie are not acceptable. So, I take my own pictures and attempt to use that function in the Varo app, literally nothing happens except that the app now takes me to a page where all of the pictures I've attempted to submit show up and the only option I have is to tap the ""Acknowledge"" button. And now I have to wait another 3-5 days to find out if I have to go through this again - which I'm pretty sure I will since the first time was perfect to begin with.

So, I continue to fight with this junk tech [VARO] in hopes that I might get a chance to actually use some of the promised features, which I'm already convinced are not going to deliver as promised because they will also be broken and, at best, only semi-functional. Wow.

In the meantime, my private personal information is floating around in VARO's clouds somewhere, never to be taken back again.

Here's question for VARO - Is VARO domestic to the USA, and if not, what is the country of origin?

PS
The latest update tries to make a big splash out of getting paid early - what a total word game. Instead of razzle dazzle, why don't you just make sure you get the features you already have to work reliably - just a novel thought.","{'id': 21267692, 'body': ""We appreciate you for taking the time to leave us your honest\xa0feedback!
