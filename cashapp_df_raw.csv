FALSE,2/9/2021 17:52,Mobile deposit,5,donkeyJA,Don’t use them and especially that mobile feature. They make you write for “mobile deposit” on the check but then will still deny it so then when you have to take to a bank they won’t cash it for you cause they think you already mobile deposited it when they denied you. So now you are out whatever amount that check is. Then when you message customer service they don’t even read your complaint. They just copy and paste a response but change the reps name on it and don’t come close to addressing your issue. If it wasn’t for so many people that I know that only have cashapp I’d have deleted them a long time ago. You get no help from customer service and they close your disputes without it being resolved so you have to constantly start over with someone new on each email. You don’t have just one person helping. It’s someone new every time and they have no clue but copy and paste some response that has nothing to do on ur issue. So don’t if you have a choice or maybe someone will read this that makes sense. I’ve edited this paragraph three times or added onto it and still no one from this company has contacted me.

FALSE,9/12/2020 14:29,Love it... but....,4,Shelby mumford,"I absolutely love this app. Money transferring is incredibly easy, and the app overall is incredibly user-friendly. It’s my personal favorite not only because it’s easy to use, but I absolutely love the discounts via boosts you can apply to your card. However,Something that’s hard when it comes down to the boosts is that the majority of the boosts I get are not for things that are local to me. My suggestion would to be pushing out boosts that are more universal. My top two favorite boosts are 10%-15% off any grocery store, and the $1.00 off any coffee shop. The app would get a much higher rating from me if those two options were permanent options that we could choose from. They are more than likely the two most used ones anyway. My only other suggestion for the app would to create an easier and more user-friendly path to customer care via app. If I have an issue it’s always “contact the merchant”And that’s stressful because not every concern that I have is always a refund. So I would’ve given the app a higher rating given that customer care would be easier to get in contact with. My suggestions would be either having a phone number that somebody can call, or an in-app chat for customer care. Overall I really love the app. It’s save me a lot of money, and I highly recommend it overall to most people. It’s my preferred method to handle my money.","{'id': 17920399, 'body': ""Hi Shelby!

FALSE,3/24/2021 23:54,Great App ALL AROUND!,4,Jeni1969$$$$$$,"I Absolutely LOVE this Cash App! There’s a Bonus I get while using this app too... It monitors the Stock Market & it lets you see how stocks by how they are performing or you can look up individual stocks & keep your own personal list to keep an eye on them! It also tracks the stocks that performed the Best Daily & Best Monthly so even if you’re not watching those particular stocks you can learn more about them! 

The only problem I have is when you go into the app and see you’ve received money from someone and tap on their name... you can send them an emoji to thank them for the cash, but you have to go to a different area of the app to make your deposit into your bank account or bank card... however you have it set up. I honestly hate this part of the app. I think that when you see the person’s name with an amount sent to you & you tap on it, when you are in that screen you should be able to DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY RIGHT FROM THERE, send a thank you emoji, keep track of your past transactions with that person, etc. without having to maneuver to multiple screens to do each thing. 

This is why I have given this app a 4 star, but in reality it’s a 3.75. It doesn’t bother me enough to change apps but it has bothered a few friends enough to have changed so it’s something I would recommend to your programmers.","{'id': 21999027, 'body': ""Hi Jeni!

FALSE,2/18/2019 19:51,Unhappy,1,Blblewis79,So when I first encountered Cashapp I thought it was the way of the future. I could transfer funds easily amongst family members and pay bills. I even had my job direct deposit my check into the account. Then my first hiccup. Seems the system shut down for the weekend and funds could not be used even if they were present. I thought let me find out what’s going on with the card. So I searched for a number to reach customer service. Found out there isn’t one. All correspondence is being done through email or text. Okay strange but maybe it was because they are a way of the future. The problem with that future is that text can often be misread or in certain cases the terminology used by email sounds robotic. So I let it pass. Just recently I was out trying to use my card when nothing would go through again. I’m checking app which is showing me there is a balance but nothing moving. Figured it was a glitch like before and I would wait. I check the app again and now it shows a new bank card number and has informed me(again by email) that my account has been closed. I still have a balance in the account but can’t retrieve it because 1 the account has been closed without warning 2 I can’t contact a customer service rep to talk about the situation. Smh. Looked up Sutton bank phone number. Nothing. Square inc phone number. Nothing. Needless to say I’m done. Moving everything over to Chime where at least I can speak to someone.

So a friend sent me funds in which I then returned within the hr, but apparently the funds were not received, although the money was already removed from my bank acct. My friend then put in a dispute with the bank, in which, rather than the app doing their due diligence and trying to find out where the funds were sent to, immediately took the money out of my acct again. When I tried to figure out what way going on, where the funds went and how to resolve the situation. I then find out that I cannot talk to someone over the phone for a quick resolution but instead via email. So I send an email notifying them of my complaint and receive a very general email in no way addressing my concerns, but notifying me that because its a bank dispute that have no further details on the issue but that they are typically solve within 90days and that cashapp has the right to withdraw the amount of the disputed transaction.

FALSE,8/9/2018 10:39,Instant Vs Free,2,TryJoy26,"When I first started using the app, I loved the convenience of it. However, I’ve noticed that nowadays, if I get money sent to me, the amount of time before I can get the money for free - no matter what amount - is days later than it was when I first started using the app. My sister sent me a mere $48 on a Wednesday, and I was given the free option for receiving it on Friday, or in this instance, pay a .78 fee for instant deposit. Even before this particular transaction, there have been other ‘days later’ options for receiving money or I’d have to pay the fee to get the money instantly, and it’s starting to bother me. It just makes no sense. If it was a huge amount, I could understand, but why charge an instant fee for such a small amount? And why not just offer the next business day? I think there should be a required minimum amount of money before charging for instant access, or at least offer the next business day just like other apps do, and not 2 or more days later. Maybe there’s a rhyme or reason as to how you all decide what amount gets charged a fee or not, or how long before money can be deposited, but I can’t figure it out. Before using your app, I had been using Zelle and POP Money, but I thought this was better and switched over. Maybe I made a mistake - I don’t know if it’s worth it anymore. I can only imagine the instant fees getting higher and the wait time getting longer over time.","{'id': 4653450, 'body': ""When you're cashing out funds from your in-app balance to your linked bank, you'll always have two options: Standard Deposit, which is always totally free and will arrive in 1-3 business days depending on your bank's processing speeds, and Instant Deposit, which carries a fee of 1.5% of the total amount being deposits, so it varies based on the amount you're cashing out. The smaller the deposit, the less you'll be charged!

To be honest, I only downloaded it for the $5 reward but that didn’t even work out. My friend and I sent money to each other so they would give me the reward. It had no trouble taking the money out of my checking account (since my cashapp balance was zero, having never used it) and it says that I got the reward. But it says my balance is only $5. This doesn’t add up since I’m -5 in my checking and +5 on the app. It should be +10 if it really rewarded me. I’m trying not to be frustrated over $5 but it’s so difficult to transfer to my bank account, so if anyone wants to give me cash I’ll transfer the $5 to your cashapp so I can delete mine and be done with it. Basically took $5 from my account since I can’t actually use the money on my app unless I want to pay someone through it, which I don’t since almost all my friends use venmo (for good reason). 

In response to the developer commenting on my review, I did do it through the link that my friend sent and followed ALL of the steps. The app even says in my notifications that both my friend and cashapp supposedly paid me, but one or the other is missing from my bank account. I did not miss a step.

To know that I don’t have the option to speak with a over the phone but via email, is ridiculous and even with that there is a 24hr wait in response.

When I asked how I was supposed to use a card without my name on it they explained that since it was a debit card I had to put money on it to use (apparently assuming I didn’t know how to use it). I replied that since businesses often ask for ID even with debit cards it would useless to which there was no response.

I was a victim of a phishing attempt that resulted in my account being hacked. I changed my info as they suggest and contacted them. They simply sent me a computer generated message on how to change my pin which I already did. Fast forward a couple weeks and I get notifications of somebody else logging into my cash app. I opened my app and removed my personal bank info in an attempt to protect its security. While I was on the app I literally watched helplessly while the other person sold all the money I had in stocks. They then requested the money from another cash app account and approved it while logged into my account. So I once again contacted cash support. I almost thought I got somewhere when they told me they’d open an investigation and asked for more info. I gave them everything they needed and was told if I had any questions feel free to reach out. I continued to ask questions because I was concerned with the security of my accounts and if my money could be returned. I never heard any response from them from there out. I even attempted to reach out to them again in hopes to maybe get them to “investigate” it all again.

Nor will they provide documentation or any written assurances showing me that the poser account had been taken down, or any other information to clear my good name.

I had an issue purchasing some items online granted it was a new site I was purchasing from and I completely understand that for security reason cash app declines or blocks the transaction because they don’t recognize it but if I am confirming it and saying it is ok then what it the problem? Here is the catch! It says decline but in reality the payment actually went thru and cash app will try to say they money was never removed from your account and if you aren’t paying attention you will follow their suggestion and use a different form of payment and end up paying twice for the same product with 2 different forms of payment.

Then I all of a sudden I was unable to make or receive any transactions. After searching the net I found a customer service number. When I finally got in touch with a rep, he was difficult to understand and initially seemed rude. When I made comment, he changed his tone and was quite helpful. He had me connect my phone to the computer and we began maneuver through the system. When he had difficulty he got his supervisor who was quite rude and arrogant. He informed me that there was suspicious activity on my account (the month before someone from across the country managed to take money from my account using square, an affiliate of theirs),and I would need to deposit 500 on my cash app and transfer it. I told him I would do no such thing and he then too began raising his voice telling me he was a supervisor. Well I resorted to using expletives, telling him what he could do with that supervisor thing (not proud of that). 

As far as I’m concerned, not only was it annoying speaking to someone I could barely understand, the fact that they had a condescending, oh well attitude. It’s unfortunate because I enjoyed the convenience of cash app. However the customer service in the event of issues are horrible.

There is no human being you can contact on the phone for this app. In fact, there is no customer service phone number whatsoever. The only option available is either reading through very unhelpful “user questions” or sending an email that may or may not ever be returned.

They responded by saying my account had been closed due to either my transaction history, refund history, or a violation of the user agreement. They refused to give me any details as to why this had suddenly happened in that as far as I knew I had not done anything abnormal or in violation of anything, and that the decision was final.

It does ask to link your debit card and bank information, which is understandable. I asked my girlfriend to download the app to send me $50 that she needed to give me. When she sent it, it went to my cash drawer. Easy enough. Then I went to cash out and it told me that it was ""instantly deposited"" into my bank account. At first, I was like no way. So I went to check my bank and there it was, $50 dollar deposit transaction and ready to use. I would recommend this app to all my college friends because it's really useful for us since none of us ever carry around cash. I do admit that I don't believe I ever received the $5 for referring a friend but I don't really care about the promo money.

My banks branch manager offered to call their customer support (because I am his third customer this week having this issue) but as I mentioned earlier they don't offer phone customer support, cowardly. They provide no proof of it being sent to my account; even the app shows it's not completed. 

My bank is now investigating this issue and SquareCash will have to prove to them where this money is. 

If you like losing money, I recommend using this app.... otherwise there are MANY other ways to send and receive money.

So I transferred money from my bank to the cash app then sent it to my son. It was blocked and denied by cash app. Unknown reason other than it was to protect me. I attempted again only to receive the same outcome. I reached out to cash app support and was told it was stopped for my safety. Ok... I advised that it was a valid transaction and inquired what I need to do in order to verify that for sending. I was told that I could try again later however it would be blocked again. No reason given. When I attempted to question this as again I verified it was a valid sending of funds, I was told that I could use another money sending app. Seriously? Sending me elsewhere instead of sending funds as the app is meant for. Ok... so I created a Venmo. Now comes the fun. When I went to “cash out” and transfer my funds back to my account, I found that I would have to wait three days until I would receive my money or I could do an instant transfer for a $7.50 fee. Not a lot but due to this being a cash app error I reached out regarding waiving this fee and was simply told that those are their fees, it will stand, I could use another app and the conversation would be ended.

It didn’t so I immediately contacted support sending them my ID photos for them to confirm my identity. They didn’t do this, they simply sent me instructions of how to make the scanner work - very condescending as if I’d not used my camera before. I then sent another support email and they said it would take 10 days for them to verify manually. This is a banking app - response times should be at most 24 hours not a matter of days. The value of my bitcoin then dropped below the amount of the goods I wanted to purchase. Yet to be sorted by customer service and they haven’t offered to give me the money back - what’s the point of advertising a bitcoin payment service if you don’t verify people on the day? I wasn’t in it for the investment.

When I asked for clarification and relayed my banks info they continued to send me the same canned message. I tried deleting that account and setting up a new one. Same issue. What angers me is that after asking for them to provide records for my account and to substantiate the claim that some “out of the ordinary” transaction took place they simply ignored ‘me.

Additionally, there is nothing saying you have to have a business account versus a personal account in order to receive payments over $500 when you begin using the app. If this does occur, then the app requires the payer to add an additional $500 to expand your account. After that, they request the money to be refunded through gift cards when you still have not received any sort of payment for the item you’ve sold. Needless to say, this business practice seems suspicious at best to me.","{'id': 20005202, 'body': ""We want to assure that the number you reached is not associated with Cash App, since we don't have a dedicated phone line.

However that isn’t the case here in my opinion. CashApp has been my go to for quick, easy, and convenient money transfers for a while now and I’ve seen it only moving up. Originally starting with a few small transfers here and there between friends led to full utilization of its many features. Be it paying a friend back for dinner, sending money to a family member for Christmas, helping someone out in a tight spot with gas money, ordering the Cash Card so I can spend my money anywhere visa is accepted, to support for ApplePay. Let’s not forget the card boosts which are awesome little perks that give you discounts on certain purchases when you apply them to your card.

They finally responded when I told them I was going to report them to the better business bureau ! When I responded back they couldn’t take my message because they didn’t attach my case number so I gave them a bad rating and I shot them ANOTHER email and nothing ! All I want is for them to unlock my account so I can get the money out but I can’t do that if they do not respond !

I had to answer those questions about 4 or 5 times with a different person each time for them to turn around and say that the charges are valid because they were authorized through a device that had access to my account. I did not authorize any payments at that time due to I was teaching class when they went through. I do not know the people who took the money. I have never sent money to those people. So I removed all my bank information from CashApp. Fast forward to the present...I went to add my bank card information on there for someone to send me money and they have closed my account due to a violation of the terms of service.

You want to put some security in place then develop security questions..Again the developer has no need to acquire an SSN or date of birth.

I was really starting to liking this app until the day I was preparing to pay someone a very small amount of money (less than 60 bucks) and before it would process my request it asked for my full SSN & date of birth and I thought why would this app be asking for such info when I’m using my own debt card from my own account,( I understand about security and so forth but yet I didn’t have to provide any of this info when I signed up, I may have had to provide my DOB, can’t recall but I know I didn’t have to provide my social) there was no need to have this info to process my request. So I sent an email to the developer and was advised to send them info they should already have, at this point it appeared that something fraudulent was going on so I immediately deleted this app, don’t have any plans to reuse.

All told I did about $900 with her. Suddenly one day my accounts have $900 withdrawn from them (the cash app had access to my account) and considered my transactions with my coworker “unfulfilled.” There was a lot of scrambling where my coworker claimed ignorance: I tried contacting square and, only after several weeks of radio silence, did I get an email (which I still have saved) basically dismissing me and telling me to check with my bank. My bank did nothing but try to figure out how square could access my account so readily; nobody did anything to help me figure out what had happened. In the end I got most of the money back from my coworker and had to close and reopen my account because my bank wouldn’t do anything to help—and neither did Square. Yes I and my friends were stupid for helping our coworker, but I’d expect something a little bit better than “it’s not our problem.”

We were very particular about how we did it to make sure we met their rules. He was new to the service - used my referral link - and connected his bank account. What happened is we both linked the same business debit card we use to add money to the account because we work together. After a week of dealing with their customer support I received about 3 boiler plate word for word responses of lazy customer service that they are denying it becuase of the shared debit card. I pointed out we met all the criteria with proof - but they seemed to scour the policy to deny the referral bonus. Does it make sense to sour a relationship with a customer over $10? I had multiple direct deposits linked to the card and was using it a ton. It seems foolish to tarnish what could be a profitable relationship for them with referrals and card usage fees over standing on foolish principal to deny a bonus. That was their choice - now I have to try and spread the word to cross every t and dot every i to make sure they live up to their promises - otherwise they will scour to deny you too - that is more important apparently than customer service.,"{'id': 13340003, 'body': ""Hi David - sorry for the trouble.

But about two weeks ago I sent my girlfriend $150 for a bill and she never cashed it out it just remained in her App, Cash App. Upon realizing she didn’t need it, I actually did. She used the refund button and it shows as refunded. I gave it a few days because I don’t expect everything in life to be instant. But I haven’t received anything at all. I’ve contacted “customer support” and they requested my identifier number as well as sender and receivers phone number and my cash tag. I provided all of it in an email response and i have not heard anything back from them yet. As I read other comments with this refund issue I realize it’s completely real and it’s ridiculous honestly. $150 just afloat with no information on where it is or when it’s coming or what’s going on. I’ve been trying my hardest to find a customer service number and I keep sending these “forms” that are supposed to be helpful. It’s shenanigans. So don’t use the refund option.

My husband and I decided to use cashapp because we heard that it was easy to transfer funds between accounts- this is essential since he travels a lot. The first payment he sent went through fine, as did the purchases that I made. Since then, though I have not been able to receive any money from him “for my protection” which makes absolutely no sense considering I’m the one RECEIVING the payment. I did not have this problem in the past when I was having money going in and out of my account regularly. Also, I can still send money to HIM- once again absolutely no sense, I can send him money but he can’t send me money.

You cannot get these people on the phone. You have to search high and low just for a phone number and when you call it gives no option to speak to any real person. It tells you to contact support through the app. When you try to contact support through the app the only option it gives you is “This Solved My Problem” (which it did not solve my problem lol) I once got to email someone (who I’m half convinced also wasn’t a real person, just automated response based off of what I stated was wrong) where they pretty much said ‘Tough luck, use a different service’","{'id': 17717176, 'body': ""Thank you for taking the time to let us know about this - we understand how frustrating this can be.

One issue is the one I can’t choose which one bank I can transfer money to cash app. For example, this cash app asked me about “Linked Account” which I put two different kind of bank is my own bank and “outside of bank” such like chime card, visa card, or chase card that are not relate to bank but it legal to use. Anyway, the point is I add my account bank and chime account on cash app “linked account” then I thought cash app probably ask me which one I prefer to transfer money from chime or my own bank to cash app. It actually subtract my chime first but I rather to subtract bank. I can’t choose what it suppose to be. Every time I have to decide which I transfer money to cash app that mean I have to remove bank then change to chime to transfer and had to remove chime again to change to bank.

Here are some ideas I believe it was make the app better:
1. I feel like if the app made it mandatory for all acceptance of money, in other words instead of choosing to accept all payments or just receiving payments without acceptance; all accounts should be able to say yes or no to receiving money to avoid sending it to the wrong person or a certain amount without having to pay the tax every time.
2. BEING ABLE TO RIGHTFULLY REFUND THE MONEY YOU SENT TO THE WRONG OR DEAD ACC. Personally I’ve been put in this situation when my phone broke and I had to make a new cash app Bc my old one was connected to a phone number instead of an email, it was very frustrating waiting on the money that I am still waiting for now a week later. Yes I could’ve put the email in too but I truly feel like this all could’ve been avoid if cash app had more secure policies.
With all that being said it’s a good app it just needs to work on the security stand point overall Bc its very important to a customer to be able to get their money without all this complications. Security should be the main priority in this app Bc it is dealing with money.","{'id': 20089697, 'body': 'Leighann thank you so much for sharing this feedback.

Not what I expected from cash app. In fact, the wallet won’t even allow me to withdraw my bitcoin. I applied for kyc months ago. The enable withdrawal button still does not work.

On numerous occasions I’ve attempted to withdraw cash at the ATM (most of the time below $500) and wasnt able to do so as Cashapp stated I was over my daily limit. This is a sporadic issue, and has only happened a handful of times. Yet, each time was either my first withdrawal of the day, or the first withdrawal in a few days. Seems to be an error. The other complaint I’d have is that it is impossible to win a dispute and have your funds reimbursed if the party on the other end either disputes the transaction or charges back through their bank.

More recently, I tried applying for a Cash App card through the app, and that’s been unsuccessful as well. I contacted customer support, and all they had to say was that their “engineers” are working on it, but they don’t know when it will be fixed and there’s nothing they can do. The app has a great idea behind it, but it seems like they’re too reliant on their computerized system, and if that doesn’t work correctly for whatever reason, then they throw their hands up and say there’s nothing they can do.

This is a warning to anyone who does not want to lose their money. Over a month ago, over $1500 of funds started leaving my bank account without warning or the ability to stop it via “CashApp Refunds” to one of my friends. It turned out a friend’s parent accidentally disputed a number of transactions sent to me by her son. I was told by CashApp I could only deal with that user to get my funds back, and so I did. He ended up canceling the disputes and having Chase send the funds back to CashApp. Si then we both emailed CashApp a number of times and provided them with every document they requested. For weeks we were lied to by CashApp support saying they did not have my funds. Only just 2 weeks ago did they aknowledge their “engineers were working on it”. 2 weeks have gone by and I STILL DO NOT HAVE MY MONEY BACK. If they could take it from me so easily they must now be able to return it. CashApp has been holding onto my funds since January 15th and have yet to inform when if ever I will get my money back. This app is either a criminal racket or horribly negligent to the point it must be shut down. I will be filing a lawsuit if my funds aren’t returned by the end of next week.","{'id': 13494352, 'body': 'Hey there - so sorry for all of the trouble with the app and your funds.

It used to be that I could pay a nominal fee to deposit my money today or it would deposit tomorrow for free. Then things got even better—they offered me a debit card connected to my app! Which I LOVE, by the way. It works wonderfully and I NEVER have to worry about overdrafting or auto withdrawals from my bank account. The fees increased some over time, and the length of time to deposit for free also increased by a day or so, but I was fine with that—the developers need to make money!

But recently the fees have increased AGAIN and the time for a free deposit has gotten so much longer. Say I get money sent to my app on Friday. I either have to wait for four days until TUESDAY for the deposit or pay $2 for a same day deposit of $133. I quit PayPal to use the Cash app because of the convenience and low cost, but I’m steadily seeing it become more and more like PayPal—it’s disappointing.

I paid with a different card then checked the cash app and turns out $15 were paid out to the restaurant even tho it said declined due to running it several times. I didn’t really want to deal with going back or calling customer service so I just let it go.

Today, it won’t let me add funds because it says I need to use a different debit card but it’s the same debit card I have on it for months. I can’t call a support number. You have to navigate your way through links to find “contact support” type up your email, and wait for a response - for this most recent issue it took 3 days for a response. For a company that holds your money, there should be NO errors trying to get to it as they’ve described and often I have had problems. There have been times when it would say I had an available balance and then decline a payment taking hours to refresh before it would show my actual balance.

I have Venmo and haven’t had a problem with it and have heard, so many safer and better things about the app. I don’t recall ever hearing a complaint about it. No hate to anyone at all. I just haven’t heard good things about the app, so I wanna give a review that might save someone from getting hacked or scammed.

My dad don’t trust things and won’t give out his info unless he knows 100% that it’s safe. I reckon it’s good if my dad had it. So if your wanting a safe and good way to transfer money easier, safe, and fast I highly recommend using Venmo or PayPal. Stay safe and don’t give out your card info to just anyone.

Here is why I moved down to 3 stars

Boost has changed a lot since I first got it. You used to be able to select your boost and that was that until you changed.  I actually first did this and their card because of the Chipotle boost.  Now the boost expires after so many days so you have to remember to go back in and select one.  Chipotle is no longer available all the time.  Haven’t seen it in over a week.  The boosts that currently exist I would not use a single one of them during a typical week so that’s annoying now.  

The other annoying thing I noticed is when you first open the app to check your balance, you have to tap somewhere to another screen to have it update your current balance.  For example, I went to check my balance, opened the app, it showed $17.  With this knowledge, I made a purchase for $12. It was declined.  Opened the app again and it said $7 (which was, indeed, my balance).  It wasn’t like that a few months ago

The good thing about the card is it is easy to transfer money to it so if you’re trying to keep certain expenses separate from other ones, it’s a good way to do that.  

It’s easy to pay someone who also has it.

They close your account for no reason (and claim they don’t have to tell you why due to their “terms of service”), steal whatever balance you have on your cash card (so if you do continue using their services I suggest you unlink your bank card), and allow others to hack into your actual bank account to steal hundreds/thousands from your account with no explanation or help to rectify the situation. They also have no customer service number (only email) so it’s impossible for you to even begin to get to the bottom of things. Then if you continue to press the issue, they ignore your emails and permanently close your account without justification. They’re very shady and bad business. Shame on them!!! I hope it’s a class action lawsuit in the future and if so, hop on board and get your coins! Because CLEARLY cash app is more concerned with scamming their users instead of being a reliable company.

Apple Pay is probably my new #1 option now. ... However beware after having cash app for 10 years they out of nowhere disabled my card and direct deposit. My payroll check for my job was going to this cash app account and when my direct deposit stopped working it was a disaster! And when I contacted Cash app for support it took weeks then after following all of their tech support requests they told me my account will no longer be able to accept direct deposit or card access indefinitely and they said that I breached their contract without telling me specifically why. And this is so odd because why not send me a notice of warning or send me a notice period. It seemed like because they couldn’t figure out what was wrong with my account or didn’t want to fix it they just took away my card access and direct deposit privileges. I’m so confused, frustrated, and disappointed. Tech support said they couldn’t do anything to help and this is just the way it is.

I guess the moral of the story is - if your friend/co-worker signs up for Cash App, make sure they don’t try to send you more than a couple bucks at first. If they do try to send you more than that, say like $250 in my case, Cash App will inexplicably flag both accounts as spamming/fraud and never let either of you send money with Cash app again.

All anyone gets is an online Q&A platform which really isn’t helpful at all. So be it for any live support cuz you’ll never get it. In addition, anyone setting the app up to accept cash is required to give out a personal PIN associated with a bank account; something many aren’t willing to do, and for good reason! I’ve had to cancel payments I’ve sent to others because of this and write an old fashioned check instead.

I initially had no problem with this move, and understood the company needing to take precautions. However, after not receiving a response for multiple days, I became instantly worried. I had money in my old account that needed to be taken out for rent immediately. I was unaware the process would be lengthy, and was directed to keep emailing with the information they asked. Still no response. Even reaching out to Twitter support became a nuisance, as the responses as I was reading from others and to myself seemed very rehearsed,conflicting, and repetitive. Fortunately due to planning ahead I was prepared financially to handle bills, however knowing there is more than $500 that is inaccessible is mind boggling. Please be wary of making transactions larger than $100. I would strongly suggest Venmo or PayPal for things like bills and rent transfers.

It’s bad enough that this money has gone missing, but the money I am waiting for is for the purchase of a youth sports team’s uniforms.

Have a weekly amount of $200, and daily of $2000, and want $150, denied.

Also, I love that stocks and Bitcoin are incorporated into it. I don’t know much about either, but I started buying this year and actually made myself some money!

I don’t know if there was an update that broke the app, but it took me uninstalling and reinstalling the app to get it to actually send a payment, and then when it did finally send, they also sent an additional payment that I had canceled HOURS ago. This wouldn’t be an issue if the person on the receiving end of the payment could send me a refund for the additional, accidental payment. However, they also can’t access their payments and therefore can’t even refund the money that wasn’t supposed to be sent to them in the first place. I understand the policies on refunds and cancellations due to the instant nature of the payments- but the fact there is NO obvious or actually helpful customer service options, plus with an app that is suddenly incredibly buggy, just shows me that the developers don’t seem to call at all about the effectiveness of their apps. We will both definitely not be using this app again.","{'id': 10077476, 'body': ""Whoa! This sounds like a horrible experience and we're sorry this happened to you.

However they’ve now rom over all of that for 2% off of CVS and Wendy’s and a pay to save system where you’ll get a flat $5 dollar discount if you make 20 purchases with the card, buy a Netflix subscription(which is more than 5 dollars and most people already have an account they borrow) or get door dash 3 times. I can’t afford door dash without the 10% discount Cash App used to offer so that’s useless, I can’t afford to pay for my own Netflix so that’s useless, so why would I put money into my Cash App card to make 20 purchases if there’s no benefit over using my bank debit card??

1. When you contact “customer service,” you never speak to the same person twice. You get a response from a different person every time which is both frustrating and annoying because each person just gives you the same generic response that the last person gave. 

2. Naturally, cash claims that the funds were indeed “sent” on their end and I was instructed to contact my bank to locate the electronic funds transfer. My bank didn’t show any record of this on the which I already knew they wouldn’t. How do you locate something that was never received?!

I like the app but don’t like this fee regardless of how small the fee is or not. PayPal has very similar features and charges no fee between parties sending or receiving the transaction as long as it between family and friends & are not using it as to pay a merchant. Am I missing something, or doing something wrong? I am trying to get the parents of the millennial give it a try but this is a big turn off and they can be set in there ways, especially when we I have to admit this small fee when we are taking about all the great pros about this app, even when this is truly one of the only cons about it.

I had $500 on my cash app card and had it tuck in my phone case. Well that same day i ended up leaving the phone at the convenient store and someone pick it up and didn’t turn the phone back in until some days later. But they still have the cash app card. So i reports that all my money was stolen off my card. I get an email saying to do a police report. Police tells me to just call the customer service number and they can handle it for me. So i email cash app dispute about it. They tell me i can’t get my money until a police report is filed. Police don’t even want to file a report and i tell cash app that but they not even trying to help me either. So basically I’m out of $500 from a theft who stole money off my card that was for my college books. I know next time not to use cash app if something like that was to happen again. Never transferring money to this card again.,

Serious I called in again only to be disrespected by another employee as I stated I will never do business with this company again he asked “then why are you calling“. I recorded all of this in case someone would like to negate my claims. 
In accordance with the law I advised all representatives they were being recorded. I urge everyone to utilize other services such as Zell or Western Union Money Graham. I believe that if a company handles financial funds the representatives should be courteous at least. As I write this the other party involved in the transaction is having her own struggles contacting support so it’s not a personal thing possibly I have some concerns though regarding the buyers motivation I would hate to believe a corporation would hire bigots.

First off, if everyone learns how the various cards and sending and receiving works it seems it would save a lot of problems. 
I don't typically transfer to my bank as I use the debit card for purchases and cash back.
I had a problem with funding when another card seemed to have issues but I think it may have been just a combination of my phone and service company and the other card( they recently changed name so perhaps that was it)
I surely like getting $5.00 each when i get my freinds to sign up and cant even describe how hreat it is when I am needy and my suster helps me , and   Ban, there it is in my cash account ready for my card ... has done that a few tomes now and that couldn’t be done before.
I always reserve the 5 star for outstandjng and usually only do 4 but I like the app and the card and Square, they are doing something right becausein the first year they went from new start up to largest lrovider of the thpe above and beyond Paypal and that says alot right there.
Look at the square app and start takjng Credit cards and having a good billing system. They offer a lot for us individual people and business persons.

You can also get your own card as a cc and/or debit card. As soon as a merchant is trying to take money out of it, it will show you immediately via text the exact amount so there is def less fraudulent activities.

Well you have to login on the web site with your email address and then add your phone number to your contact info. Once you do that it will ask you if you want to merge the two accounts into one account. After that the app opens as normally would with all your info already there. 

The reason this happens is because you never had your phone number added to your info on the web site so when you redownload the app it thinks the phone number on the device is a new account when it actually isn’t a new account. The app just doesn’t recognize your account because you never added your phone number to your info on the web site.

Poor chargeback support:

Good luck getting a refund from a merchant for non delivered goods or poor quality service. Cash App is just a front for Sutton Bank and it's almost impossible to get a successful merchant refund. 

Does not work outside of the US:

I use this card all the time. But I was surprised that the card didn't work when I had a two day trip to Canada. I'm sure this is in the fine print somewhere but this restriction was definitely not obvious.

No Bill Pay:

Cash App does not support any form of bill pay. 

Quicken Export:

If you use personal finance software to manage your funds then you'll find that cash app doesn't support an easy way to get your data into personal finance applications. Note you can export a CSV file but that only lets you open it with Excel or Numbers. 

Finally: 

If it weren't for the boosts I probably would completely delete the app but I'll keep it for that reason only.","{'id': 13090281, 'body': ""So sorry for the hassle with the Cash Card.

I usually only have to spend a few cents on Venmo to deposit my money unless it’s a high amount, then it’s a little more.

1. they cannot recover ANY of my money.

2. You’re telling me I can easily get into the stocks I love right here in this app when major platforms like eToro tell me anything outside of crypto is off limits? Man...how naturally attractive CashApp is looking right now.

This is where the “6 stars if I could” comes in. Man, did they do me proper!

The UI is pretty good as is the UX, no they are not one and the same and it makes a difference that apps get both right.

Secondly, when it come to them responding via email they take 2 days for someone to even respond. When you message them it is never the same person that responds back to your email in which once you tell them the issue, they all repeat the same thing over and over.

Lastly, Cash App deals with two different banks who don’t even deal with the money transactions that are being made. You cannot call the banks dealing with a a cash App issue. Basically if you do call them, they just send Cash App an email making a note that you’ve been trying to reach them. 

I had a company send me a withdrawal to my cash app account which I now know that you cannot send an amount over “10,000 within a 24 hour period”. Cash App immediately declined my transaction and said it would take 1-3 business days to get sent back to the creditor.

My only suggestion is within the tab of the stocks that’s says shares owned, share price, company symbol, and company value, I want to know my average stock price that I have purchased the stock at. So like if I purchased a $10 stock and it dipped like to $6, I want to know the average stock price of the stock that I have bought it in. 

Overall, it’s a really easy app for beginner investors and if you don’t have a lot of money, you can do fractional shares.","{'id': 22249110, 'body': ""We’re always looking to improve our products based on our customers’ feedback, and enjoy hearing from you about how we can make Cash App as useful as it can be.\n\nWe'll be sure to pass your request to the rest of the team.

Whoever I spoke with kept sending me vague ideas on how to solve my problem but none of them actually involved a solution.

They said to try withdrawing smaller increments of cash, and I’ve tried that over the past two weeks all the way down to five dollars and nothing has changed.

What upsets me the most is the person said they generally only provide customer service through text and email, which to me means they have a phone number they only give it out in circumstances where it’s needed. Well I kept requesting the phone number because my problem wasn’t getting fixed and that he said they don’t have a phone number at all. Which is it?

If you would like to accept the 17% charge for depositing immediately it deposits it right away.

Square... step up your game. I will be following up with legal action even over $250 because sometimes the principal of the matter outweighs the cost.

App Cash is not a trusted app. You cannot trust that if someone transfer your money that you’ll be backed up on the transfer. They can hold you money and NEVER get paid. 

WHAT A NEST OF THIEFS!!!
Read below.

The app developer replies with the same crap as the others. Just solve the freakin issue instead of giving the same crap of send an email our team will take care of this. Jus FIX the freaking problem and PAY ME. I lost 145 dollars for using this stupid app.

This app is super awful. Since day one I could not get paid. They said I had to be verified. I followed the instruction. After several tries, I got “approved”. There is not a support number. The support info is not helpful at all.
Then, I tried to get paid and it got rejected. 
It’s been a pain and awkward to ask to be paid several time using this app. So so sos awful. I’ll give a 0, there is not an option.

I sent 2 emails free my account was authenticated and no one replied to me.
I asked them to pay me what was paid to me. 

The poor person who transfer the money said that she was charged of the transaction. The person tried 3 times and always failed. I mecer got paid and I’m not sure if she got charged 3 times, but I bet that they did since all the transaction failed. 

As I said the worst app, support ever.

Cash app makes it all but impossible to speak to somebody unless you want to dispute an entire claim that is not a face-to-face transaction. I don’t know why they advertise the $1 off but don’t honor it.

It’s quick and at your fingertips BUT recently I’ve been having some issues with the app and their customer service. I recently had to file an $80 and the process with their customer service is so long I just took it over with my bank. After that everything was fine up until today when I tried to send money. It kept rejecting my Wells Fargo card that I used before and also kept advising me to order a Cash Card when I already have one. I emailed their customer service team and received no response. It’s making me wonder if my account is having issues because I filed a claim. Whatever the situation is I would love for it to be resolved so I can continue to use the app.",

I then tried calling the cash app customer service but they have no number listed on their site. I then googled there number and on the first page it showed the number. I called it up and a very accented Indian answered and said he was with square. He then asked for my cc number and my social security number, he then logged into my account. But towards the end of me speaking with him he wanted me to go to a gas station or store and buy a iTunes card for $20 which then told me it was a scam but it’s too late cause they now have my cc number and all my personal info.

Recently it’s come up 2-3 times for Starbucks but that’s it. There’s a few other places that popped up in boosts that wasn’t near or in my state.

I cannot pause life for 45 days. Cash app needs a better response plan in place to ensure their customers do not go hungry before they can determine a resolution. They’ve seen the unauthorized transactions that took place in the east cost while I’m in the west cost and haven’t been to DE. They’ve seen the NY transactions and still will not refund my money.

Open an account with a regular bank. Way better protocols in place to handle fraud.

The best perks is the cash app card!!! You get discounts at coffee shops, grocery stores like Whole Foods and fast food restaurants.

I would suggest 2 new features/options. 

Being able to “hide” purchases, or delete them? Maybe have another tab where things purchased with the cashapp card isn’t with the transfers from your bank. Separate the transactions made with the card&bank acct option. 

An easier way to send funds without it coming off the card vs. your account. I sometimes send random amounts to the card with the expectation to save it. If I need to make a transfer - it automatically comes from the card vs. my account. I want to keep the funds on the card, and pay or send from my acct.

FALSE,5/22/2018 6:29,Not so free,3,phoebefromfriends,"There are two options when “cashing out” into your bank account: standard (a few business days) or instant (with a fee that correlates with the amount deposited, ex: $7 = 11¢ fee, $25 = 85¢ fee and so on along those lines). I usually do the instant because I don’t mind a few cents here and there to support the developers, but when it comes to transferring a couple hundred dollars, the instant transfer racks up to $10+. 

My problem with this app is that when I choose to use the standard transfer option, although they already have ALL of my bank information, I have to re-enter it and there is ALWAYS a problem, which then prevents me from using the standard transfer.

FALSE,3/9/2021 19:28,Beware: Cash App is a Hub for Criminals,1,DinostarNM,"The biggest pro of Cash App is that it’s pretty easy to send money to friends and family. However, that’s basically where the safety ends.

Various articles have determined that Cash App is one several instant financial transaction places where scamming occurs. There is no net security to protect or retrieve any funds that you may lose as a victim of a scam. 

I made the mistake of sending money for an item for a Facebook Marketplace ad. The seller requested I pay via Cash App and so I did and when the funds were transferred, the user blocked me. Caps App provided its false sympathy and said it can’t do anything to get the money back. They think by messaging the scammer, they will have a good heart and return the money — yeah right! 

My advice is: only use this app for people you truly know. If you have to send money to someone you don’t know for purchasing for ads on Craigslist or Facebook, I wouldn’t trust it. At least on Facebook you’re covered on their policy.

Because of all the criminal and deceptive activity that can occur between receivers and senders on Cash App, I wouldn’t be surprised if Congress or Federal authorities take action someday against the creators or specifically start baiting criminals engaging in scamming/fraud.

So let’s recap... I added my debit card, verified my mobile number, linked my bank account, took a picture of my driver’s license, and took a picture of my debit card. Yet with all that, I’m not able to transfer money until I allow the app access to my contacts??

Very convenient. In the two years I’ve had the app I’ve only had one problem and it was recent. I was logged out of my account and didn’t have the information linked therefore couldn’t use my funds. The customer service was delayed (my incident occurred during a tremendous influx of other emails) however, my problem was fixed and I had access to my funds again.

I have read other reviews where numerous people shared my problem and my advice would be to update the method for logging in. Use the $Cashtag, email, or phone number linked to the account as the login name and give the option to have a password to login, fingerprint, or Face ID. Maybe use the current method for when glitches happen with the fingerprint and Face ID. Or if the person forgot their password. There would be a lot less emails to customer service.

Cash App seemingly has nothing in the way of even protecting its customers in an event like this because they are afraid everyone is a fraud that would be contacting their support and will not hand over any account information or sensitive information whatsoever. Shopify says “create a new account” to fix the issue but what happens to the customers who have made purchases who you can not receive the funds from? Are you supposed to shell out more $$$ from your pocket to complete the transaction when your money that is legally yours is sitting in a cash app account that you can not access?

With that being said, there should be measures put in place where I can get my money back if it’s in a certain time frame. I noticed my payment error within minutes. I couldn’t call no one, and the only way of communication with support is via email. Even chat would be better because it would be faster help.

Recently, I used this app to send someone $70. When I entered the amount, I thought it was odd that the screen displayed $070 instead of $70, but I didn’t think too much of it until I hit “Send”. That’s when I saw that the app said I sent $770 and not the $70 that should have gone out. 

I tried to look for a way to cancel the payment, but the “Refund” option the developers refer to on the Support page was never available to me. Nor was there any other possible way to cancel the payment. 
When I reached out to their support team, their tech just said, “Sorry to hear your payment was sent but you input the amount incorrectly,” ignoring the fact that I said I did not enter that amount and not even considering that there could possibly be a problem with their app.

Not only that, but the auto-response I received after submitting my request for the refund said that I would receive a response within 24 hours. But it took 37 hours!

So now I’m out $700, because Cash App’s buggy software sent the wrong amount, and they won’t even stand behind their own product!

To me, I think it’s foolish and not intirely profitable when the money you make from the +4% off investments is taxed about the same when you pull it out x3.

I do have one gripe though. I wish that when you cash out to your bank account it would let you “review” the cash out before initiating. I need to know it’s going to the right bank account. 

I recently had an incident where I cashed out a large sum and it went to the wrong account(I have 2 accounts to cash out to). I assumed the funds would be there on the date they said it would be there and so I assumed it would. I then set up a payment for a credit card on that date and assumed it would be there. 
I come to find out that it didn’t arrive at the  account and instead into my other account and I ended up overdrafting the account I thought it was going to, and now owe a 35 dollar overdraft fee.

I signed up for a cash app account in 2018. I used it once, and largely forgot about it.

CashApp sent no email to me since posting of this review, so Developer Response is laughable. BUYER BEWARE

Original Review: 

I used CashApp to send $10 to someone I thought was honest. While the mistake was mine, the people at CashApp state they are a regulated financial institution.

Usually financial institutions, such as banks and credit card issuers, usually have a trail that can be used to trace and recover/reverse questionable transactions. All I got by email was statements to the effect of “sorry the funds are no longer in his account.” and “You could request that amount from the person you sent it to” as if a scammer is really going to refund my money. 

CashApp and Square obviously don’t have a Fraud Department, since all of my emails were handled by the same person. They gave no indication that they even have a fraud investigation process.

Lesson: Use CashApp at your own risk, which seems pretty high, since if they are a financial institution they have almost no security protections in place, and they ignore all detail when you try to tell them about potential fraud. I have deleted my online CashApp account and the app.  While this app is popular, I urge consumers to avoid CashApp like the plague, and I urge Apple to remove it from the App Store.","{'id': 10304213, 'body': ""Hello.

And then the lady blocked my requests where I asked her for my money back. I tried to dispute it with cashapp but they did nothing. They said I waited too long to dispute it even though I did it a week later and in their policy it says 30 days. So thanks for ripping me off. Just a FYI they told me to send money only to people I know. I sent the money to my cousin and I contacted cashapp support numerous times and they did nothing to help.

Now the real reason I am writing this review is because I want to complain a little bit. The reason I don’t give the app 5 stars is because it only allows trading with BTC and the BTC trading function itself is extremely limited, when in fact Square should be stepping up and letting its users store and purchase many more crypto currencies than just BTC.  The cash app is perfect for storing and trading BTC, if only you could offer this same service for LTC and ETH (LiteCoin and Ethereum for those that are not aware are both considered to be very popular crypto currencies each for their own respectable takes on how their block chain is implemented.)",

Their chat feature on the app was not working and said to try later. I was able to find a phone number after searching the Internet. The recording instructed me to use the chat feature on the app. 

My opinion is there seems to be no way to dispute transactions through the cash app. Not does there seem to be any concern. I did email them after deep diving into the app and found an email address. They did answer advising me to contact the store directly. 

Not sure what government agency regulates this app but it is not a bank but they want you to direct deposit your paycheck to them. 

The bottom line is someone was able to get my card number and complete a credit card transaction. They did not need my pin number. 
I have concerns about the cash card and their security and their lack of support and their inability to dispute transactions.

FALSE,2/4/2020 22:21,I can explain why there are bad reviews,5,Impatient94772,"They are using them as a bank. That’s where they get wrong. I read their review and most common complaints are trouble with hotel deposit, gas station, deposit cash. 

Keep in mind, this is a debit card, not the same as credit card. 

Hotel: it’s recommended to use credit card, not deposit, so they can take out for deposit then put it as pending. Till you check out, they can cancel it. So you can’t do that with debit card. 

Gas station: I had the same problem, when I use it for gas, it shows asked for $100, order has been canceled for insufficient funds, that’s because it’s using it for deposit, when filled up, then you’ll get the rest back. So they’re probably didn’t have enough money in there card. They get notifications right away when they find out. While other cards don’t. 

Deposit cash: just withdraw it to your bank then cash out. It’s cheaper than Atm fee anyway. 

I love their investing feature, it’s worth looking.",

I really like this app and plan to use it for saving money for vacation. That being said I think a really good feature since we have our debit cards linked is to allow an option to round up to the nearest dollar when we spend and it go straight to our cash app card. I know other apps do this but im not interested in investing and unsure of ease of access to money added to those apps.

But like any other bank account I would like to leave at least $100 in the cash app Incase I decided to use the card. But the only option for moving money to another personal account is to literally Cash Out Everything. Hoping this makes it back to developers and they allow me to choose how much I am sending to my self just like when I send money to anyone else. If this is already doable on the phone app please let me know.,

1) sometimes charges take a while to show up, or the amount of money I have takes a while to reflect the correct amount. 
2) notifications don’t always work, or are extremely delayed. i’ve had to turn on push, text, & email notifications because of this. 
3) the widget you can use randomly decided to stop working, & just says “unable to load” which is just really inconvenient for me personally. (this is my newest issue)
4) there is a persistent badge notification on the app that will not go away, so i’ve had to turn those off. that’s been an issue for about a year now. 
5) this is very rare, but sometimes when sending or receiving money, it will indefinitely pend. sometimes the money will go through while pending, sometimes it won’t.

They could give no reason why they blocked the receipt of funds, only said that “You can finish this transaction outside of the cash app”

They wrongfully took money out of my account after I had already paid a recipient .

After emailing back and forth with CashAPP, since they don’t have anyone to speak on the phone with and speaking with my bank and the recipients bank, I was wrongfully ousted out of my money. The recipient to date, has not received the money after this happened in January of this year.

This app is unreliable, stressful and just a piece of crap. You are better off using Venmo, do not waste you time. Protect your wallet and bank account by using Venmo or PayPal. They are far more reliable, have customer service in the event of an error occurring and they won’t rob you of your money then tell you they can’t do anything about it.

Save your bank account and yourself from the stress. It’s honestly not worth it.

Just an additional FYI, they will reach out to you to save face and tell you to reach out to them through email since they are “looking into over the phone discussion options”. This company is a complete waste of time.

He responded again with the TOS link and then said “I’m going to go ahead and disconnect the chat.”

Now a year and a half later they have me in limbo again not knowing what the next course of action is. When you call square they can't even reach this leg of their own company but through email.

Cash App:  Turn the door knob
Me:  There is no door knob. How do I open the door?
Cash App: Turn the doorknob
Me:  There is no doorknob, here are 5 screenshots to show you there is no doorknob.  Can you show me where the doorknob is bc your instructions aren’t working or is there another way to open the door?
Cash App:  Turn the door knob.

This went on for 13 exchanges.  I think I finally got to a person, but they simply responded that the doorknob goes away after 2 weeks so too bad.  Of course, it went away, I spent a month trying to get an answer from them.  I complained to the Better Business Bureau and I am still getting stonewalled.

I downloaded the app this earlier this week and I am still unable to add money to it.  ALL my attempts are “transfer failed”.  If I’m having this much trouble putting money in, I don’t want to think of the hassle to take money out.
Customer service is a complete joke, no live support for an app that handles money is unacceptable.  Email support is all generic answers.

Please make this friendly for children! Secondly because my daughter has a cashapp with my bank info attached I was not eligible for the $5 for using my sister link for a new acct which is not fair it’s a new acct we should still be eligible for the $5 for the person referring us.

I used $20 at a metrocard machine and the screen indicated that the transaction did not go through.  But the balance was still taken from my account!  I emailed customer service repeatedly.  They went ahead and just shut down my case instead of helping me.  I’m just appalled.  This app stole my money.  If you read trust pilot, customers are losing $5,000 at a time.  Fortunately, I have only lost $20.

That being said, this app is not safe to use and I will likely report it to the better business bureau.  

First review—
The boost did not work.  It worked for the first few transactions and then stopped working.  I contacted customer service.  Customer service instructed me to follow four steps to dispute and request a review of the transactions.  The steps lead you to a screen that doesn’t even have the option to review!  

Contacting customer service 6 times is also extremely unpleasant.  Since I’m being charged random amounts with no boost, I do not trust this app to be linked to my bank account.  I repeat I DO NOT TRUST the app now.

This is the easiest application in the world to use, it’s all about in, out and done....anything more And they would personally have to physically bring you your bank or bank card whatever you prefer and do the transaction for you, while sitting right next to you, so that you would comprehend just how simple it is and how well it works.

While they are within their rights to do that, not only was Cash support unhelpful, unresponsive and unreachable (there is no phone support and they tended to respond only when I approached either their social media team or reached out to them via Square as a Square user), they never responded fully to my email queries, lied about when the returned funds would be available and made no meaningful effort to get the hold on those funds released. 

The result? Funds I needed to cement a rental were unavailable for four days. Fortunately, when I explained all this to my bank, the bank went out of its way to help me. As for Cash, in the end it completely it ignored me, refusing to even address the issue.

I recently ordered from UberEats. When the order was placed UberEats sent a receipt which said “a hold of $4.30 has been placed on your card. It should take a couple days to be removed from your statement.” 

I contacted Uber 4 days later, Uber told me that it was CashApp, not themselves. Then I contacted CashApp. First time I contacted them they took 3 days to reply and told me they could do nothing for 4 days after that (14 day holds are common I guess...) so I waited til the 14 days were up. On day 15 I contacted CashApp a second time, I have YET to hear from them...And that was 4 days ago. I no longer expect they’ll give me my $4.30 back.

I can handle the 14 day policy (though that’s a long wait itself) but I have proof that CashApp failed and that UberEats does not have the money, but still I have gotten nowhere.

 There is no way of knowing if it’s down or not so every time you use the card it’s a gamble.

If you’re going to use this card be sure to keep double the balance spent or you could end up completely screwed over. Don’t rely on it to hold onto money you need or to spend money you need spent. 

If you are looking to constantly have declined payments and unanswered emails about money they stole from you then this card is for you.","{'id': 6983666, 'body': ""Hi Clyde.

If one is sending money through the widget of IMessage they would have to scroll to get the amount they would like to send. It’s been too many times where the wheel to scroll wouldn’t stop on the amount I would like to send. My solution to it is instead of the wheel just add plus and minus signs so one could just tap to get to the amount they want and if they hold the button to increase by 10.

They’ve sent me the same email three times and ended it with we cannot provide additional support or information. I wish I never used this app. They’ve literally stolen money from me.

Nothing.

I file another support request through the app and receive an immediate (almost automated) email that my case was closed “because it’s been more than a week since we’ve heard from you”. With directions on how to open another support request.

So I do that. And again get the same automated message that my case was closed.

1. Introduced a Sign In with Apple ID method to log in faster than email/phone

Money from someone and then I got an email saying it was on hold and gave me a number to call and lift the hold. Apparently there’s a 100$ fee and and I called and it seemed like a women on the other side of the phone call and kids yelling in the background. I hung up and she texted me and started telling me to send money here or there because neither were working. I think it was a hacker because throughout a good hour of hassling . It went through one of the tags and I never received the money I was supposed to get.
