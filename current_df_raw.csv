2,Hacked and customer service no help,agauth79,8/13/2020 3:13,"Update** Three days later and the hackers are still attempting to use my daughters account, despite our reporting to Current the issue, and changing passwords several times. I had to have my parent side of the account removed completely to stop the scammers from trying to deposit money from my end. The scammer also tried to scam my younger daughters card as well. Lucky for us she had ignored the calls/texts before anything happened. 
Original review: The card we have for our kids got compromised. The hackers/scammers were very smooth. Had all of us fooled. The company isn’t being very helpful at this moment about returning the money, either. And even after contacting them about the fraud, somehow these scammers are still trying to use my account to steal money through my kids’ compromised account. I can’t remove the linked checking. Can’t pause it from making Deposits. It should only be allowing access via my Face ID, yet they still got in again. Looks like this is a new frequent issue for current users with these scammers yet no warning was sent out about this new scams. I  do NOT recommend anyone use Current cards for your kids. They need to do better about security and be better about returning fraudulently stolen money and about earning customers when new scams are on the rise. We’ve been working with them for over two hours and there’s still no real resolution","{'id': 17246158, 'body': ""We take your account’s safety seriously and we are always here for you whenever you have any questions or concerns.

3,Easy but not helpful,DaddyOkane,3/14/2021 17:02,"Current is ok only reason I’m writing three stars is because customer service is honestly garbage. And they promote that there was $100 overdraft which honestly that’s not true at all.
But back to my original complaint about customer service I had an unauthorized use and someone used a little cash out of my account and when I contacted support they basically said it would take three to six months to get that payment back after I fill out a mountain of paperwork and all that they could do is cancel my card and send me another one, but in the process they canceled the wrong card so I was stuck out and they did not ship the new card faster they basically told me to deal with it or use another Bank to link a virtual card so I can pay for stuff for my kids .they were not helpful and honestly I won’t be with them for much longer .only good thing is you will get your paychecks faster and tax return fast but outside of that it’s really nothing good.
And if you change your phone number it is basically impossible for you to get back into your account even if you have an email link to it and they did nothing to help my wife she is still locked out of her current and the money is still sitting in there so basically they said deal with it so Hope this helps dudes","{'id': 21693395, 'body': ""Hi there, thank you for your review.

1,Not pleased,sirenxo,12/4/2020 23:51,To first start out I’ve had a bad experience with Current. This is my first debit card and I am not pleased with it at all. First things first I tried transferring money into the account and after about a week it never went through so I tried to dispute it and NEVER got my money back (this was months ago) so I decided to stop using it because after that I didn’t want to lose any more money. I’ve finally decided to start using it again as I’m looking for a job and it’s currently the only debit card I have and I went to look at my account inform and Current has signed me out of my account on both of my phones. I’ve tried signing back in but it literally makes me create a whole new account which I don’t want to do and the support email for current is no longer in use and I never reach anyone when calling. I don’t see anything about a sign in issue on the website and what to do if you can’t sign in at all so I have no clue what to do. There is literally no sign in option on the app only a “get started” option as if to open a new banking account with Current. Are you really that desperate for new customers that you try to make them open up a new account if they can’t sign in to an existing one? I’ve received no help from anyone despite trying and like I said never got my money back from the first time and now I can’t access my account.

1,Deceitful,GrayDeBeast!!!!,5/21/2021 1:28,"We have been huge Current fans for the last couple of years. We’ve recommended Current to countless friends and neighbors.  Until, my daughter received a fraudulent charge on her account. She notified Current within minutes, blocked her account and awaited her new card and a refund of her hard earned money. She received the new card and notice that Current did not agree with the dispute and that Current would not refund her money. I then spent 90 painful minutes typing away in their app (there is no phone service) being cut off several times if I wasn’t typing quickly enough, only to be again told that her $ would not be refunded and there was nothing I could do. So, I requested that all the money in our accounts be refunded and the accounts closed. I then spent another 30 min trying to withdraw my money to face constant “errors”. My very helpful “chatbot” suggested I use the debit cards to withdraw the funds from an ATM - which would still leave Current with money in the bank since atms don’t give less than $20 and certainly not 50 cents. I am down to being owed $19+ (plus the bogus charges they allowed someone to steal from us) and will have my attorney follow up. My recommendation is to stay away from this operation.  All is well until it isn’t, and once it’s not, it unravels quickly.","{'id': 22986664, 'body': ""Hi there, thank you for taking the time to leave a review & we're terribly sorry to hear about your experience with us.

1,Do NOT bank with these crooks!,jdubhair31,10/24/2020 8:38,"I had my card information used on a transaction and, at the time they were my financial institution. I locked my card and instantly contacted Current. To be told that I’d have to file a dispute which turned into a 6 month long battle. I have since switched banks to a regular big name. For $21 a month I was charged for them to take my money elsewhere. I canceled my account 81 days into the dispute. They had no idea when a “dispute representative” would call me. Even after they said by end of day each day I contacted them. The phones route you to the app support which if they don’t want to answer a question they just end the chat and refuse to answer again. The best description for this bank is: if you like stressing out over why your funds are being taken, this bank is the bank for you. I have since found a stress free banking team at Citi Bank. Back to the 81 days into the dispute. At 101 days they email me saying the dispute was complete that they refunded the money. Now, after all that they won’t respond to my support emails asking to reactive to transfer my funds out. Go figure right? They have had to do this to others. They have got the science to screwing people down. Day three of waiting for a response on them letting me get my funds out, still no answer. They do not even deserve 1 Star!",,FALSE
5,The Current is Currently Perfect!,I$ab!,6/1/2021 19:59,"Funny true story. The payroll company that pays me uses a service that if I pay a fee they give me an advance on my paycheck. Well I signed up for it because the first time was free. Well when they go into the account to pull the funds to give me an advance they say I don’t have any money. Now I’m confused and a little upset but ChaChing here comes Currents notification! My finds are already available! You just know I had to tell that other company that they’re fixing to go out of business and some think that’s rude but I call it “get your crap together, know that in these times you must stay on your toes because their will always be better!” Thank you Current I appreciate you!

3,Needs work,almondxmilkkk482,7/24/2020 14:53,"It’s a good app all together, I do have an issue with the customer service. It takes forever to connect to a representative & once you do it doesn’t notify you so the representative usually just ends the chat if you don’t respond in a few minutes so you have to wait all over again to finally get connected to a new one. Also, if you need to dispute a charge that also takes forever. 30-45 business days I believe which is normal but I should at least be able to get my money back before that especially if it was fraud.
I also don’t like the gas holds feature, say for example you only want to put 20 dollars in your tank & that’s all you have in your account, the gas station will try to charge you 100 bucks instead of 20. So it just declines at the pump and you have to pay on the inside.
If you want to go to a bank atm to withdraw money, the atm already has a 2-3 dollar fee since it’s a different bank, but on top of that this card charges you another 2-3 bucks so all in all your fee is 5.50 or something like that which is way too much.

1,THIS APP IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!,mysialachelle,2/6/2021 19:11,"I wouldn’t even recommend this app even if someone held me hostage and forced me to. I never wanted to cuss out a customer service agent so bad. They are clueless and can’t do anything and clearly don’t know how to communicate with customers or each other. They give you a virtual card to use while your waiting on your physical one to arrive in the mail..what they don’t tell you is that you can’t even use it!!!! I tried to use my virtual card with the Apple Pay feature and it didn’t even work. I contacted customer support asking them if the virtual card works at any stores that accept Apple Pay and they told me that I can use my virtual card at any store I can have to accept “credit” instead of “debit” since my virtual card doesn’t have a pin. IT DID NOT WORK. Then I talk to someone else and they tell me that my virtual card is only accepted by merchants who accept virtual cards...after I just tried to use Apple Pay, with a merchant, WHO ACCEPTS VIRTUAL CARDS.

1,DO NOT MESS UP,Emmalulurose,3/18/2021 19:07,"I was somewhat enjoying having the app as a teenager, but it was impossible to do anything without an adult supplying the money. Then once I turned 18 it locked me out until I could provide proper identification. I put in the wrong stuff and they locked me out permanently. I emailed them and they didn’t even respond to my question. I guess they have default responses when it detects certain words because I said ‘information’ maybe twice and the email back was about “sorry you’re concerned with the information we take”. Um, what? Nice to know they don’t read it until the second email. So it took me 2-3 days to figure out I have to find a new application and there was nothing they could do for a mistake——it took less time to receive appointment approval for a mammogram during COVID. You might think, oh can’t you make a new account? No. Never. You can only make an account via the app and you can only sign in with the same details after that so the apps useless on my phone now.

In conclusion: Don’t get it as a teenager unless you have someone willing to give you money, DO NOT mess up an ounce of information or you’ll lose everything in your account, and expect your questions to take at least 72 hours for a proper response.","{'id': 21763744, 'body': ""Hi there, we're sorry to hear about your experience using Current & we apologize for the inconvenience.

1,Do not get it!!!!,TRAVIS!!,11/14/2020 4:11,Get ready because your about to hear a long story as to why I gave this app and a very generous one star. Least start off by saying at first it was fine when using the teen account when my parent would send me money if your only going to use it for that your fine. But DO NOT i repeat DO NOT use it for direct deposit ITS TERRIBLE. I put money on my card and noticed that it was not showing up on my spending balance so I contact the support people. Mind you THEY HAVE NO PHONE LINE. It’s all through text. And they tell me that on their end it’s showing up that I have money on there. I explain to them I can’t purchase anything because it’s saying my balance is zero. they couldn’t do anything for me so I had to wait 3-4 DAYS. Thankfully it came but not in a timely manner. So I have them a second chance. I used direct deposit I got paid two days ago with still nothing in my account I gave them some time because Veterans Day was the other day. But today I decided to contact them to see what’s going on after 15 mins she tells me that my money arrived in another account HOW IN THE WORLD DID MY MONEY ARRIVE IN ANOTHER ACCOUNT. I only have one account so what other account is there.......... and that’s why you should NOT USE CURRENT FOR ANY DIRECT DEPOSITS OR ADDING MONEY,"{'id': 19147163, 'body': ""Hi Travis, thanks for leaving a review and we're sorry to hear about your experience.

I was happy that I got paid two days early but I wasn’t happy about the late deposit. Nevertheless, the good part about Current is the fact that they send you balance updates when you make a purchase. The updates include the amount you spent and the remaining balance on your card. I also like that you can tap your card to pay. That’s a pretty cool, fast, and efficient feature as well. So far, I haven’t had any major issues with Current. I gave them 3 stars because of the late deposit and the rude customer service rep. I may come back and update my review over time if positive changes occur. So, as of now I would say give it a try.

Rather than Current’s automated call center and faulty mobile app as well as extremely slow and embarrassingly poor customer service assistance for a so called “Bank!” I’m not one to complain but I rely on my checks weekly and when you have no access to control your funds for this long and no shown actions to assist your customer with a crucial issue, I felt the need to alert others that it’s obvious you have no concern for your customer’s needs, especially a “Choice Card Holder” You would think paying the extra for the better checking account might help get quicker assistance or any assistance period!

I’ve banked with Simple for yrs but recently found out they would be closing. I found Current and thought it would be similar to Simple and set up an acct. I added money to my Current acct from my Simple acct which took around 5-6 days for the funds to be available for me to use. I then tried to use the photo check deposit. It took 4 days, 6 if you count the wknd, for my funds to become available to use. I don’t have the option to use direct deposit, because I work for a small business that doesn’t offer it as an option.

With Simple if I had my photo check deposit submitted before 4:00pm on Friday, my funds were available by 2:00am on Saturday.

I have stated to them that my son has also tried to access my acct because the number that was attached is no longer in service or he no longer has that number. It’s been over 2 weeks and I have yet received a response by email nor by phone call. I thought this was a good card and it’s seems to be but how when you can’t even get a Customer service agent to assist in getting you back into the app to request for a new card and update your information. I have sent over 10 emails I have called almost 10 times leaving messages for HELP. And guess what no response. Can Someone Please Help Me get back into my Current Acct.    
           Another week which makes 3 weeks and still no response by email nor by telephone.","{'id': 21269793, 'body': ""Hi there, we're sorry to hear about your experience and we'd be happy to investigate this further.

1,Not recommend,ejn🧿,11/13/2020 13:22,"I decided to try this app because I have a teen with a job, and thought this would be a good way to start their “banking lessons” without the penalty of overdraft fees from an actual brick and mortar bank( Wells Fargo, bank of American...). From a distance this look great!
Not so much, you can not add cash to your teens card because it’s not allowed!?!? But then you can’t add cash to the parent side either your forced to link it to another bank. Customer support work around was to delete the app and then reinstall it. Which I did and nothing changed, Super annoying! 
When you transfer money from your actual bank to the current app it takes a full day to post even though it’s already cleared /deducted from my bank account.
Then when you mobile deposit a check (my teen’s payroll check to be specific) it takes 5 business days. Five days is a little ridiculous especially for a payroll check, and no where on the app does it tell you checks take 5 days to clear until after you endorse the back of the check🤬

5,Thank you mr beast,Bear42790,5/9/2021 4:36,I have been with about 4 other cars like this also a few banks and I have never received anything from not one of the subscriptions. Right from the start with this account I was already been given some prizes for applying and out of the goodness of Mr. Beast heart he also gave me a present that helps out a lot for a single father.I’m not saying that you will receive the same things as I did but what I do know is that you will be well taken care of as an individual not just a number like the others. Thanks again  mr beast and current card.. so what are you waiting for sign up and start feeling Better about your finances..

1,Worst banking app EVER,Officialsummerdawn,11/27/2020 16:41,"I had my direct deposit set up on this app, I received it but it was pending and I googled it and said it would be several days so I reluctantly upgraded to premium, which still did not release my funds. It took about two days which wasn’t too bad. But now when I went to go use my card I can’t because they canceled it to send me my premium card... so now im going on day 5 with no access to my ENTIRE PAYCHECK. I’ve tried hooking up to cashapp with the “virtual card” cashapp said they didn’t accept this. I tried paying someone through apple pay to try to get my money off, the app won’t let the payment go through. I have no way to pay my bills, no way to get myself gas or food, the money is just stuck o the account. Not to mention I tried to reach customer service and all they have is the chat option and the person did nothing to help me whatsoever. I tried routing the bank account to cashapp as well, does not work. Why would they cancel the card I have to send me the premium card????

I'm still waiting for my 36$ bank transfer that i did literally the day after i activated my card then i tried to order food and it took off the payment twice and they are still holding my money. I don't understand this company and i've seen a lot of reviews on instagram about how they are scamming people and stealing money i will be sure once i can finally figure something out about my pending money and my missing 36$ to cancel my account and make it my life mission to help other young adults like myself not use this app for all this guys just use venmo they are the greatest i have no issues with venmo and it's basically like current just a lot better. so please whoever is reading this DO NOT USE THIS APP NOR CARD it's a scam and they are going to steal your money in a blink of an eye and ignore you and act like it's your fault.",,FALSE

U can Pause/ or UnPause your  card in seconds & even Block certain companies from taking any money. Plus my company pays us on Fridays but Current drops my Direct Deposit 3 days early. I Freakin Love the card, I have no idea why people give it bad reviews but it definitely deserves my 5 Star Approval.

1,Current card is not a good debit card,G'Luv Lopez,5/26/2021 20:34,I would not recommend anyone to get connected with current due to the fact that money was withdrawn from my account without my consent and when I called customer service they basically told me that they couldn’t do anything about it that I will have to call to whoever took the money so they could put it back that they were unable to do it themselves that they would have to do an investigation within three days so that my money can be reimbursed back they talk about no hidden fees which they do have they talk about that they’re on able to do anything or give me my money back and it was not only the first time that it was done I definitely think that I will not give you no stars due to the fact that they never resolve my problem with returning the $110 that was taken from and every time you would do direct deposit they would take a percentage so the whole paycheck was not going through advice to everyone if you do not want to lose your money do not connect an account with current,,FALSE
5,Great for adults but the teen app is amazing!,RFdenver1981,4/26/2021 15:04,"The developers did a great job with the feel and flow of the interface.  The Current debit card is also nice because it is NFC/Tao enabled - even the big banks haven’t been doing that until very recently.  
The teen app is even better than I expected it to be.  For my kiddo I was looking for something that functioned like a real checking account with an associated debit card.   The Current product does this and it’s software is amazing!   I can setup chore lists, my daughter can setup savings “pods” for the things that she wants.  I can monitor all of her activities and even have the ability to restrict where she spends at.

ETA: in response to the developer, even with other companies when a deposit is shown as pending it is still applied to your balance and the funds are made available for use, unlike with you guys. I shouldn’t be left stuck waiting and unable to use my fund from my paycheck for days, even when the deposit is put in my account a day or two earlier than the actual deposit date for my job.

For the most part it is good but I do not like being “tricked” “mislead” and that’s exactly how I am feeling very mislead!! I had a normal bank I was overdrawing and being charged crazy rates well Current comes along advertising we will cover you up to 100 dollars with 0 fee just be a prime member and get $500 plus monthly in direct deposits ….. well here I am in month 3 with around $600 a WEEK in direct deposits guess what my over draft capabilities are? $25 dollars! Big help a whole $25 dollars they say they periodically review you for a updated amount I asked? When does that happen? Customer service didn’t know. Other than that it’s been a good card I’ve even gotten  $50 added to my card from Mr Beast but I am very upset about being mislead about the overdraft because that’s what lured me to leave my bank and get this to begin with,"{'id': 23313005, 'body': 'Hey there, we apologize for the frustration!

It’s been 3 weeks since I was able to use my money and be struggle because of this bank. I tried to contact someone at support but no luck . No professional person to speak with on this matter at all just automated voices and emails with they don’t even reply to. I pleaded to just let me take my money out and leave the bank but I can’t because they are stealing my money and refuse to let me take my funds. This is unprofessional and scam like banking which is not to be use. Sorry current you shouldn’t have took my money thinking you were going to get away with it.

I was told my initial conversation over a week ago that my account would be reviewed and resolved in 24-48 hrs. We’re now a week passed and there hasn’t even been contact on their end. It’s EXTREMELY upsetting, bc prior to this incident I was really happy w their service. That being said, if an issue comes up and you’ve been dealing w it for over a week and nothing has happened it really makes me start to question having my direct deposits coming to an account where if something goes wrong... you don’t have the confidence that they’ll be able to fix it in a timely matter.

1,Nothing but lies don’t download,ricksnachezmortysmith,3/28/2021 20:02,Okay so the very first thing that interested me in the app was the 2 days faster direct deposit. Lies only 1 day faster. I also pay $5 a month for they’re premium card which is supposed to come with more advantages. Newsflash it doesn’t. They’re supposed to have $100 overdraft fee free. That’s another lie. Customer support is complete garbage they really couldn’t care less about whatever issue you call them about. They’re also supposed to give back instant gas withholds. Yet AGAIN another lie from them. Recently because of tax season I’ve used them to get back my tax return. They’re app says you get it 5 days faster than with any other bank. People around me got there’s within 3 weeks of filing. It’s been nearly over a month for me and still nothing. I plan to close my account after receiving my taxes because this is honestly ridiculous.

This app has a super affordable yearly fee, it’s easy to use, it always works and we’ve not experienced any glitches in the service.

Also, I did not get a single notification from them about this issue, which would have been helpful so that I could have solved this problem right away.

5,Current- my two cents,anmlvs,5/30/2021 0:23,"Current is an amazing mobile banking account that can definitely make banking SUPER simple. The savings pods are super nice but I believe there is only 3 pods (at the moment) I’d love to see upwards to like 10-15 pods. Just to diversify your savings. You can also round up purchases to your pods which is really nice. But it’s still not that known by other major services such as Experian. I tried to use Experian boost but Current was not available as a bank account. Maybe in the future. It’s overall a really good first bank for teens. 

Despite the MANY MANY MANY SCAMMERS on Instagram, it’s still a good bank. NEVER SHARE YOUR INFO WITH ANYONE NOT EVEN CURRENT THEMSELVES THEY ALREADY KNOW YOUR INFORMATION.

What I would LOVE to see is a current credit card. That would be AMAZING.

Getting paid up to 2 days faster is also nice because well who doesn’t like getting paid early? 

No gas holdings is really nice. 

Havnt tried to current rewards yet, don’t really plan to but if you’re into that go for it. 

You can talk to service reps directly through the app. 

You can cash checks with your phone which is also a really nice feature.

Overall 9/10 amazing bank.",,FALSE

I NEVER ONCE AGAIN, got my deposits at the same time that I use to when using The Bank of America debit card that The NJ Unemployment office originally sent me. Instead my checks started showing up between 1-8 hours after the time that I use to get them through the Bank of America debit card and the reason I switched from them is because. I couldn’t use their card through the cash app 100% of the time. Most weeks, it just would not process any of my add cash or pay request??",,FALSE
5,So glad I did this!!,hhgguihhgggf,1/12/2021 4:40,So my other bank I was constantly having issues with them of trying to get money back that was taken out of my account and it’s been two years and I still never got my refund that the company gave me and sent it to them but they lost it and can’t find it to give me my money back so go figure!? So I saw the advertisement for this and I figured why not give it a try and I’m so glad I did because when I have an issueOf money coming out of my account I can contact someone there they open a dispute and they give me my money back quick!!! Anybody that is thinking about changing to another bank current should be your answer because they are amazing!,,FALSE
5,Much more than a sleek design,Jimbadrow,10/4/2020 3:57,"Let me first say that this is the most visually pleasing banking app I’ve ever used.   The color schemes are reminiscent of neon lights in the darkness and the interactive facets of the design are smooth and perfectly responsive.  

It is so much more than aesthetics.   Early direct deposit with free overdraft, cash deposits at stores, fee free ATM’s, instantly refunded gas station holds, customizable savings pods, easily lockable virtual and physical cards, a unique cash back feature where you can buy cash for your account with points earned by swiping at stores  that have multipliers for money spent up to 8 times with an easy to use map to find where to get the most, free overdraft protection, a unique brand blocking feature, referral bonuses and spending tracking by category and brand, custodial accounts for your children and multiple budget builds make this banking app stand out in the crowd.  

55,000 free ATMs and no minimum balance are just the icing on the cake.   I would like to see an investing feature or crypto currency section in the future, but this app is at the head of the class already.

1,It was good,boston2506,9/18/2020 22:59,So apparently they offer a service called overdrive on there website if you meet their requirements. They will let you overdraft 100 on your account untill next payday. Which is very helpful for some. The requirements is u have to buy there  premium check and have at least 500 each month in direct deposits.  I have had this account for months and get way more then 500 each month and paid for the premium checking and still I don’t have on my account. I contacted customer service only to have someone that was completely rude tell me they won’t review my account.  Why you offer a the service then?  Is it just to lure people into opening the accounts. Seems pretty scandalous.  And another big problem is you can’t connect your bank to plaid which I hope they will fix. I would say it’s a okay bank but don’t open a account if you read that they offer overdrive.

My husband couldn’t have access because you have to provide your Ss# and we didn’t want to give this place so much personal info.

Cons: has verification problems when logging into different devices, long wait for customer support, can't call only online chat, and if you can't bypass the phone number verification you have to contact support somehow only.

And I still have not received anything, no updates from the “dispute team” somehow the customer service can’t ever get a response from them. And you can’t even call these people. Due to covid reason that’s just an excuse. Can’t they work from home just like every other bank in the world is doing!? And every time I chat with someone I get the same response.

But adding easy ways to grow our own income throughout your financially system and help to generate income on a potentially significant level.

I see people raving that it’s good to fund their kids’ allowance.
 I signed up for the premium account, which is $4.99 a month. 
You can waive that fee by spending $500 first ONLY in specific places on the map provided (which demands to track your precise location in order to work AlWAYS). You collect points when you spend at specific locations, then you can “buy” the option for a month free. 

No interest if you decide to use savings pod. (I personally didn’t expect this feature but just in case anyone was wondering.

But the biggest problem I have with the app is the $3.50 to reload. Whaaaaat the heck is the point of the card? I might as well buy gift cards. Since it’s loaded through vanilla? 

MOBILE check deposit? NO. Don’t do it. I made a mobile deposit with a small amount first just in case and I’m glad I did so. The estimated clear date was extended one day. They lag and I have a feeling it’s on purpose. I mean god forbid a $7 check were to be wrongfully deposited.

-Built in tools like budgeting tracker is really cool

Forget about customer service, if you have a problem, though. You have to threaten to quit the service to get anything more than a re-read of the FAQ. 

My son started working. Got a work check, from a US bank, made out in his name. They rejected the check. Which is no fun, since you have to endorse to “Current”.

They cited the FAQ, for the rejection, but it didn’t make sense.
